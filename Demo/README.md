# GZDoom Demos

These are recorded Demos in the GZDoom. However, we used this to record scripted maps without having to `TITLEMAP` the entire title screen.

Unlike usual (Between credit screens), the Demo plays after all credit screens have passed.

## Sorry, GZDoom now broke the entire Demo thing

We must discontinue this effort for now. When the demo ends, it goes `Unknown Exception`. Everything, no idea how did this happened, is it because we loaded other mods when it got to process stuffs?  
Therefore we unfortunately has to scrap scripted map demo indefinitely, and the only way now is `TITLEMAP`, ew!!
