# Random Scratchnotes

Here are random scratchnotes idk what to do but it had to be stored before I forgot it.

## Remind idk

- Don't touch my button! An overprotective Cyberdemon dormant, gets triggered when you press this button & then tries to revenge up in your ass.

## Idea

Cool ideas that scope is way too huge for me to realize now, but maybe you will?

- Zenless Zone Zero TC. Entire Unity Game, remade as a Gameplay mod PWAD or better, drastic Total Conversion with maps complete with the 1 to 1 gameplay
- Dangdut in GM1 MIDI. Soundtrack for Doom WADs using Dangdut styled song. The one that goes e.g. dung tak dung
- Demo.MID. Doom Demo system but instead using Standard MIDI format. Keypresses go to Notes. Feedbacks are Text inputs. This feedback tells that this event should happen, and if in that happen the actual game did not say the same at that exact moment, that mean you likely have cheated or used wrong mechanism, or compromised demo. It can also tell overall this would desync with this mechanism setup.
