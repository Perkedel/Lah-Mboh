# Random Scratchnotes

Here are random scratchnotes idk what to do but it had to be stored before I forgot it.

## Remind idk

- Don't touch my button! An overprotective Cyberdemon dormant, gets triggered when you press this button & then tries to revenge up in your ass.
- US style residential house where the actual boss is. You've teleported right onto him the Spider Mastermind on accident when stepping on mysterious sector as you see it in Automap. Don't worry, we can resurrect him, lemme get you back. Followed by stanley parable open giant happy ending No. 1
- [Diabolus EX](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/101473-gzdoom-diabolus-ex-v11/) has Neon grid

## Idea

Cool ideas that scope is way too huge for me to realize now, but maybe you will?

- Zenless Zone Zero TC. Entire Unity Game, remade as a Gameplay mod PWAD or better, drastic Total Conversion with maps complete with the 1 to 1 gameplay
- Dangdut in GM1 MIDI. Soundtrack for Doom WADs using Dangdut styled song. The one that goes e.g. dung tak dung
- Demo.MID. Doom Demo system but instead using Standard MIDI format. Keypresses go to Notes. Feedbacks are Text inputs. This feedback tells that this event should happen, and if in that happen the actual game did not say the same at that exact moment, that mean you likely have cheated or used wrong mechanism, or compromised demo. It can also tell overall this would desync with this mechanism setup.
- Baldi. **NO!!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! STOP!!!**
- Basics in Behaviour Miss Cirlcle. **HELP!!!!! I CAN'T RESIST!!!**
- Gacha. **NO NO NO NO NO NO, WAI WAI WAI, WHEY WHEY WHEYT!**
- Assassin Creed TC. After disappointing misdirection from Ubiosoft, you know, this had to be it.
- Godot instead of Coherent Lab. IWAD selector made with Godot instead of proprietary HTML engine. It also has built-in Source port, more like
- GODOT. Doom but Godot instead of that Doom. not an [importer](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/125581-what-does-doomworld-think-of-godot-engine/), [really](https://github.com/DataPlusProgram/GodotWadImporter). It plays WAD & GRP directly, replicating every mechanics of DOOM, Heretic, Hexen, Strife, Quake, Build Nukem, etc., like the effort was with the [rescratched into Rust](https://github.com/Henrique194/iron-doom).
- Freedoom Phase 3. to cover Dhewm replacement pk4.
- Ironic Outcomes. An H Mod PK3 TC that also replaces guns with water guns & hydro themed lobbers. This is to rant against certain regulations & bureaucracies that despises violent gun games like Doom, sprinkled with Duke-sussy-baka style of Gal-gun. Llike Korp's Furdoom, Gib is replaced by Thrown. Something you would find on N game store. Shake it baby!
- Smoking cause cancer. A Jokewad that adds a new Thing set of cigarette. These adds buffs & also punishment token for whole gameplay. Max 5 consumption before the next becomes cancer. Cancer works like ZZZ's Hollow Zero corruption, up to 5 you can have with unpredictable bad effects. So if you died, the Reload save also includes last cancers you have when you last saved. You can find rare medicine around that can remove 1 cancer.
- Time Crisis.
- 3D Modelled map. Instead of typical BSP, the map is empty but a special 1 Thing which is the map itself. You can now model maps in Blender then load it here. Now you can floor above floor above floor and so one iyey!
- Libdoom. Like with the case of [Libsm64](https://github.com/libsm64/libsm64) (Super Mario 64 Decompilation as Library), This library makes Doom portable & can be embedded to various video games & game engines.
- Fdroidoom instead of DeltaTouch. Plagiarize efforts of Beloko of compiling Doom source ports for Android, but it's Open Source, at least BSD or Apache Licensed or better. And yess, DRM Free!
- Insert Coin. GZDoom addon that makes the experience Arcade, where you must insert coin to play. There was score doom, but uhh idk the fate.
- Spooky Jumpscare Mansion. It was not GZDoom. Somekind of weird Engine I've yet to recognize, and then in the HD Renovation is Unity before the Great Next Betrayal of Installation Fee back in late 2024.
