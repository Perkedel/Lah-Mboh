# Random Scratchnotes

Here are random scratchnotes idk what to do but it had to be stored before I forgot it.

## Remind idk

- Don't touch my button! An overprotective Cyberdemon dormant, gets triggered when you press this button & then tries to revenge up in your ass.

## Idea

Cool ideas that scope is way too huge for me to realize now, but maybe you will?

- Zenless Zone Zero TC. Entire Unity Game, remade as a Gameplay mod PWAD or better, drastic Total Conversion with maps complete with the 1 to 1 gameplay
- Dangdut in GM1 MIDI. Soundtrack for Doom WADs using Dangdut styled song. The one that goes e.g. dung tak dung
- Demo.MID. Doom Demo system but instead using Standard MIDI format. Keypresses go to Notes. Feedbacks are Text inputs. This feedback tells that this event should happen, and if in that happen the actual game did not say the same at that exact moment, that mean you likely have cheated or used wrong mechanism, or compromised demo. It can also tell overall this would desync with this mechanism setup.
- Baldi. **NO!!! YOU CAN'T DO THIS TO ME!! STOP!!!**
- Basics in Behaviour Miss Cirlcle. **HELP!!!!! I CAN'T RESIST!!!**
- Gacha. **NO NO NO NO NO NO, WAI WAI WAI, WHEY WHEY WHEYT!**
- Assassin Creed TC. After disappointing misdirection from Ubiosoft, you know, this had to be it.
- Godot instead of Coherent Lab. IWAD selector made with Godot instead of proprietary HTML engine. It also has built-in Source port, more like
- GODOT. Doom but Godot instead of that Doom. not an [importer](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/125581-what-does-doomworld-think-of-godot-engine/), [really](https://github.com/DataPlusProgram/GodotWadImporter). It plays WAD & GRP directly, replicating every mechanics of DOOM, Heretic, Hexen, Strife, Quake, Build Nukem, etc., like the effort was with the [rescratched into Rust](https://github.com/Henrique194/iron-doom).
- Freedoom Phase 3. to cover Dhewm replacement pk4.
