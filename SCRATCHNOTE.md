# Random Scratchnotes

Here are random scratchnotes idk what to do but it had to be stored before I forgot it.

## Remind idk

- Don't touch my button! An overprotective Cyberdemon dormant, gets triggered when you press this button & then tries to revenge up in your ass.

## Idea

Cool ideas that scope is way too huge for me to realize now, but maybe you will?

- Zenless Zone Zero TC. Entire Unity Game, remade as a Gameplay mod PWAD or better, drastic Total Conversion with maps complete with the 1 to 1 gameplay
- Dangdut in GM1 MIDI. Soundtrack for Doom WADs using Dangdut styled song. The one that goes e.g. dung tak dung
