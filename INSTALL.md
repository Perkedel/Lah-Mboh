# How to Install

This Doom mod is a patch WAD PK3, meaning you are still required to own a copy of the IWAD.

> Apparently, we used textures that turns out may or may not, are full exclusive to FreeDoom, where

> Congratulations, fraggle, & friends. You've successfully **OutPizza'd the Hut down into Ristorante!**  
> **Incredible!! What an achievement!** This is not sarcasm btw. It's pure from me iyeay!
> And eh, we are targeting FreeDoom Phase 2 anyways.
> Don't believe us? Try it. `doom2.wad` or whatever id IWAD it, & compare.  
> Only the [Kinsie-test](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=57221) inspired room on the right tunnel were supposed to have blue checkerboards (GZDoom `-NOFLAT-`). Nowhere else.
> The console should not spit Texture Missing errors at all.

## Steps

Showing the easy & quick ways

- Download GZDoom & Extract
- Download FreeDoom ~~or purchase Doom WADs on Steam or GOG~~, & extract / locate the IWAD.
- GZDoom should automatically find your commercial Doom WADs installed when you launch. But for others, you can simply place the desired IWAD inside the GZDoom executable folder (put the IWAD next to `GZDoom.exe` / `.bin`).
- Launch GZDoom
- Test everything correctly.
- Once done, close GZDoom again, then drag this project folder / pk3 onto the GZDoom.exe. It will launch with the PWAD PK3 in hand.
- Select the same IWAD then launch.

> [!TIP]
> It is highly recommended to use Doom launchers of your favourite to make mod selections easy.  
> Due to high numbers of various mods, which each has different asset replacements & even experiences, it is always the best to organize the launch arguments.  
> Therefore, please use the launcher you desire to make your Dooming life a pleasure. iyeay!
