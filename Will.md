- Public copy of source codes

## Wishes

I wish that after my death, for whoever to hold Perkedel and some and/or all of its endeavour, to abide these following mandates:

### Paywallism

In an event of such worst case scenario right in economy, throughout sectors beyond related here, You are allowed to impose paywall (even by the worst basic) on such as digital, biological, or otherwise certain writings that's considered a soft product, **on few conditions**

#### Time limit & Fund goals

A software may only have maximum time or fund during this paywallism window.

Decide how long should paywallism takes. I recommend about 2 years after the launch.

Decide how much should product receives its revenue. I recommend about 25 times its price.

Either:

- Funding goal has been reached, **immediately becomes $0 & release all source code if there are some that's not yet publicized**
- Funding goal did not reached in time limit (of 2 year), **immediately becomes $0 & release all source code if there are some that's not yet publicized**

#### Scope of the paywall

The scope applies equally to any parts of the product, right it is a main, down to its modules (DLC).

### Source Code

As Perkedel Technologies is an Open Source first company, I wish everyone whoever to control Perkedel to always upload source code to the public since the beginning as possible. Any private repository that's there shall be immediately shared at appropriate time.

#### Scope of Publications

I wish that all source codes (main & its modules / DLC) contains no codes that got ignored, unless if the code contains sensitive parts (read below section), then maintainer shall provide the replication codes that removes those keys, to make sure it still can compile.

It does not matter if the product at the time is on paywall or under Perkedel / DNB contract. **The source code must be ready for public right from the start**, & if under contract or basically must be private first, must be treated like surprise birthday party where it will be revealed by defined time, **no else**.

#### License

The main License should be the usual I have been choosing from the get go, which are:

Softwares: GNU GPL v3
Websites: GNU AGPL v3
Assets: CC4.0-BY-SA

I recommend that you avoid licensing any of the project Public Domain at this time to prevent abuse from irresponsible parties.  
In event that the protection spans has lapses (70 years upon my death for Earth, infinity for free culture projects on DNB realms), you shall discuss whether or not the OG projects turned to PD, or stays copyrighted *open-sourcely*. I personally recommend that you keep those copyrighted *open-sourcely* under the company Perkedel / DNB. As long as any of the freedom imposed with my licensing decision from my lifetime does not revoke in the process, this will suffice.

#### Main author

You may write who ever is the lead maintainer & who's the main author of the first ever commit of the repository with whoever the name it is.

If the first every commit was that name, then it's `by` that name.

You can add extra `by` names, e.g. the idea source it comes from.

```
by XYZ, ABC, & MNO
Perkedel Technologies
GNU GPL v3
```

#### Sensitive parts

If the source code contains too sensitive parts, only thing that I definitely know what not to publish are:

- Passwords & API Keys. These usually contains rights access to all stuffs in modules and if shared, irresponsible people will ruin it down to its foundation.
- Library that comes from proprietary company. (Yeah who the hell told you to use Radek's DMX?! He's stingy! Well if that's inevitable choice at that DOS era, then you've learned the lessons anyways)

I am unable to have absolute recommendation for the personally sensitive parts (such as potentially patent infringing, sparsdating, etc.) since they are very bespoke.  
This shall be discussed with all peers whether or not should this be unignored / set repo to public, or stays ignored / keep repo private.
