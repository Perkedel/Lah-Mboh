# DoomRunner Bundles

These are file references bundle files you can add to your [DoomRunner](https://github.com/Youda008/DoomRunner). It contains only the references to which mods to be loaded.

They are in `.dmb` files, & they are just a **plain text file** with each line a file reference path.  
Read those files, especially on the core dependencies of what mods you should acquire.

It is also possible to put a `.dmb` file in another `.dmb` file!

## Get started

Add the bundles in the [`Add These to Runner`](/src/DoomRunner/Bundles/000-Add_These_To_Runner/) directory. You need:

- `Core`. Mods loaded most first
- `HUD`. Mods that enhances HUD
- `Testers`. Test Levels including Lah-Mboh
- `PreMods`. Mods that enhances gameplay

The `HUD_Alt` file is optional. This will be used instead of `HUD` for a Total Conversion mod that benefits such alternative HUDs, such as Project Brutality.

## Play your maps & mods!

You can now load your favourite maps & mods. Later in the future, we will also have pre-configuration bundles for you to just plop it in by reference.  
These bundles will be at `Load Favourite TC Extras`.
