> Only way is to fork it those. If.. they *`made a mistake licensing it with caveats against them in event of their assholeness`* lol.
> Yeah you saw that's too few of them as so. And not all clean room a success. I only know Freedom because doom.wad & so on are proprietary.
> And I haven't heard success someone forking XYZ into ABC because Mr. XYZ went wreak havoc karen yadi yada. Any? I forgot. I am in someone wishing to fork XYZ to ABC,
> coz I have been hated by alot, breaking points. What's the point of the vent room if only your reaction to terminally hate me and mark me as creep?
