## A Random Doom Stuffs

I tried Doom mapping. So this is how it feels to BSP? That's way too different for that time they used to map Doom. Okeh, lemme go on with those challenges.

You know, I.. used to design levels WYSIWYG. 
Put objects there, arrange there. And that includes walls, floors, & 
ceiling (yea I know that's inefficient unlike yours with BSP). Come from root that's youngest, such as Unity, Godot, etc.

but eh.. both disadvantages & advantages on each own idk.

## ~~Second~~ ~~Third~~ ~~4th~~ ~~3472983749th~~ Whateverth Ever Patch WAD designed exclusively for FreeDoom

*hmm, mega? will it be?*

> The second ever? What was the first?

[**THIS!**](https://www.moddb.com/mods/freedoom-badss-editionmappack) from Backyard Badasses. 
Yeah, the Jokewad talking about FreeDoom itself ft. crazy overcharged weapons replacing the main ones. 
It also has special episodes too as well!

No, it's [this](https://www.moddb.com/addons/freedoom-phase-2-freedom-on-earth1). There's more.

Wait. I swear to God, I was initially intended this whole endeavour to **softly designed** for FreeDoom (which means you can use just `doom2.wad` if you prefer). 
but I accidentally made it **exclusively designed** for FreeDoom instead (which means no more `doom2.wad` compatibility).  
Blimey lmao, I used textures that turns out it's FreeDoom own thing haha! Too lazy to change back, too cool to avoid, such as tempered glass (`GLASS` textures).

Uh.. I hope you okay with this right? At least FreeDoom is Gratis, Open Source (BSD Licensed), & Full Version..  
And you just saw, it OutDoomed the Hell into Fraggelicious (**OutPizza'd the Hut into Ristorante**), surprisingly hehe.

## iYEAHi

Enough yapping! let's go ahead & see here around.

## How to Install?!?!?!?

This Mod is a PWAD and you need to have a copy of a Doom IWAD.

Use [FreeDoom](https://freedoom.github.io/)!

See [**`INSTALL.md`**](INSTALL.md) to get started.

## Features all features contributors must pay attention & comply if you'd like to contribute for us

- Wholely different map name & `MAPINFO` references. Does not replace current IWAD namespaces
- Open Source. I mean that's obvious who we are, and also.. we **expect you do the same**. .. yeah.

see [`CONTRIBUTING.md `](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more informations.

## Features

- Does not replace assets (Nor Episodes, Nor Maps, nor anything). Compatible with other Doom mods! Infact, designed to test Mods
 - Except unused items such as Unholy Bible & Evil Sceptres. Yeah, nobody would ever cover this IWADly anyway, I think. These are just useless Item completion items from Press Release beta, and it's just removed by the release of Original DOOM.
- Benefits GZDoom, ID24 (**NEW**), & various other features
- Wide variety of tests
- Other levels you can try

## What's with the name?

This entire project was supposedly named `I don't know man` something: `idkman`. But of course, you just saw it touches id software 
trademark which can cause whole confusion, which is a big no no, we are not affiliated with id, nor Bethesda, nor Zenimax in anyway.  
So, let's translate this keyword into something else. 
My mom comes from a region in Central Java, hence she speaks Javanese beside default (Indonesian) on her daily basis. 
There you have it. `mboh` means `idk`. When someone ask about the context and you have no idea how to properly answer the question, we shout `lah mboh?`.

## You could just put whole level editing idea right in your `CVR_Stuffing`
[`CVR_Stuffing`](https://github.com/Perkedel/CVR_Stuffing)

That repository is already too big for this Doom stuffs, and considering the way people make GZDoom mods like that, a WAD as a folder, to be compiled as `.pk3` file & 
basically Modern Doom WAD making in general, it'd be more efficient to just place everything we do as its own repostory. 
After this, we can make other repositories as a patch complementing this main patch (if necessary of course, No, everything non-replacing shall be here this PK3). PWAD after PWAD iyey!

Now, for the CVR stuffs, that's for Unity levels now (& possibly other XYZ Engine Games that requires bloatware project files not just Unity, such as Unreal etc.). And let's put that aside.
