## A Random Doom Stuffs

I tried Doom mapping. So this is how it feels to BSP? That's way too different for that time they used to map Doom. Okeh, lemme go on with those challenges.

You know, I.. used to design levels WYSIWYG. 
Put objects there, arrange there. And that includes walls, floors, & 
ceiling (yea I know that's inefficient unlike yours with BSP). Come from root that's youngest, such as Unity, Godot, etc.

but eh.. both disadvantages & advantages on each own idk.

Enough yapping! let's go ahead & see here around.

## How to Install?!?!?!?

This Mod is a PWAD and you need to have a copy of the IWAD.

See [**`INSTALL.md`**](INSTALL.md) to get started.

## Features all features contributors must pay attention & comply if you'd like to contribute for us

- Wholely different map name & `MAPINFO` references. Does not replace current IWAD namespaces
- Open Source. I mean that's obvious who we are, and also.. we **expect you do the same**. .. yeah.

## What's with the name?

This entire project was supposedly named `I don't know man` something: `idkman`. But of course, you just saw it touches id software 
trademark which can cause whole confusion, which is big no no, we are not affiliated with id in anyway.  
So, let's translate this keyword into something else. 
My mom comes from a region in Central Java, hence she speaks Javanese beside default (Indonesian) on her daily basis. 
There you have it. `mboh` means `idk`. When someone ask about context and you have no idea how to properly answer the question, we shout `lah mboh?`.

## You could just put whole level editing idea right in your `CVR_Stuffing`
[`CVR_Stuffing`](https://github.com/Perkedel/CVR_Stuffing)

That repository is already too big for this Doom stuffs, and considering the way people make GZDoom mods like that to be compiled as `.pk3` file & 
basically Doom WAD making in general, it'd be more efficient to just place everything we do as its own repostory. 
After this, we can make other repository as a patch complementing this main patch. PWAD after PWAD iyey!

Now, for the CVR stuffs, that's for Unity levels now (& possibly other XYZ Engine Games that requires bloatware project files not just Unity). And let's put that aside.
