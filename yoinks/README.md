These are Mod PK3 WADs that we have to include, not built-in however, due to various reasons.

All you have to do alongside other dependencies, is to load these too. If you have existing Mod PK3 at the same name, use these instead.  
e.g., we have fixed bugs temporarily until the original author updated it, forgor to compile latest version, etc etc.
