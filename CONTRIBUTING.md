We trust that you've read & agreed with our general Terms of Service [here](https://perkedel.netlify.app/terms) & our Privacy Policy [here](https://perkedel.netlify.app/privacy_policy), these at hands.

We also have to stress that you must ensure what you're about to submit is what you drew yourself, or if yoinked, you have either received permission from the author and/or auto-granted by the license of the yoinks you're using.

With that out of the way, Now, carefully read & comply with the following instructions & rules of what can you do, must do, and avoid to do below.

## This project is SFW Only

Lah Mboh serves as the base for all DNB / Perkedel endeavour in Doom mapping & moddings. We have analyzed, for safety of audience who happens to seek & ponder upon your gameplay experience, 
we have stood the rule that ensure that the base right here is free from far fetched contexes, beside goriest guro depictions, DOOM is all about.

### Special only for this endeavour, you are allowed to submit anything into this PK3:

- Insults & Rants. Complete with uncensored swearing.
	- Disstrack.
	- Broken mods. [The sun is leaking](https://youtu.be/SkHo4wCmrEQ). a rant about oh so broken HL2 mod. Tragically, due to this callout, the mod dev added malicious measures to make the entire HL2 EXE (with that Overcharged mod installed) crash if it was played using those Steam accounts, which are noclick, Radiation Hazard, & friends. see [video](https://youtu.be/YcvsbZ18izA) from noclick for context.
	- Copyright Takedowns. such as Viacom Bersalah (Viacom the Blamed), a rant about Spongebob Massacre WAD takedown by Paramount Pictures which is a subsidiary of Viacom. Similar tone & vibe to `The sun is leaking` meme but for Indonesian.
- German Chancelors & its symbols. **Be careful however, despite this all being about Wolfenstein, the region DE (Germany) still dislike this idea**. Therefore we recommend you to refrain from ever involving those symbols & depiction. If you have to, it is best to omit those elements. See Wolfenstein New Collossus DE distribution version!
- Reproductive Jokes (used sparingly). Example:
	- Cryptic Genitalia depiction & discussions & used as a joke or rant.
		- [NUTS.wad](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/m-o/nuts). A Map replacement PWAD, where this map contains over thousands of monsters. Waking them up puts your skill & even the Source Ports to the Benchmarks. Therefore `NUTS` here means `Insane` / `gila` rather than the scrotum.
	- Jiggly Sexiness concealed & semi-concealed. Such as ones found in Hoyoverse Zenless Zone Zero very prominently. Not even hiding the fact at all.
	- sussy baka! Reproductive inuendos as long it is 10 step before the *showtime*. 
	- Duke Nukem 3D sussy baka stuffs (retaining the censor on those)
- Vent
- etc.

### But you are not allowed to submit into this PK3:

- Actual Fictional Pornography. Please use & submit to our NSFW extension PWAD PK3 instead `ngocrot-deh` `LINK_HERE`. Example:
	- H
	- Encounter
- IRL Pornography. No extension PWAD indefinitely. not to be confused for `ngocrot-deh`.
- Derogatory N-words. This neither covered even in NSFW extension. use our Derogatory extension PWAD `wok-wak-wek-wok` (pls link) (small note: no color derogatory allowed at all there even! only G-word I think!)
- Death Threats. No Extension PWAD.
- Suicide Encouragement. Zero tolerance, no PWAD.
- Doxxing. No Extension PWAD. Even to public companies (with known HQ locations & contacts) where context & intent is to cause raid & also compromise anyone safety whose completely nothing to do with the drama incident, in-all eitherways.
- Non Free-Culture stipulated files. Those file violate our distribution goal (that includes but not limited to such as Arcade machines, Embedded Device Toy, Linux Distros). use our NoCommercialable extension PWAD `Bring-Your-Own-USB-SFW` pls link.
