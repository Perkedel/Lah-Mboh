This is a collection of textures for DOOM from me, Meerschweinmann.
Mostly BIGDOOR related.


Not everything is made by me from scratch. 
Nevertheless, i invested many hours in it.



There are 3 versions of this WAD file.

The HC (highcolor) version includes some textures as 32bit PNG.
The PAL version includes all textures as paletted variants.
The VE (vanilla enhanced) version includes a Crispy DOOM/International DOOM/Woof
compatible Texture1 lump.


It is recommended to use ColdPal for the paletted and vanilla enhanced versions,
because the blue of the big screens and the blue planet on PLANET2B texture look
too oversaturated with the original DOOM palette.

You can download ColdPal from ReaperAA here: 
https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/graphics/coldpal 

The two ColdPal files can simply copied in the WAD file with SLADE3.

But you can use every other color palette with desaturated blues too.




The doors are variants with different sizes of ID Softwares original DOOR 
textures made by me. 
Everyone with eyes should be able to see this.
By the way, i love the BIGDOORs since i opened my first at E1M1 in 1994 :)


In the "32in24-15 Tex" pack i found a 256 pixel wide gray BIGDOOR named BIGDOORC.
Because i wanted it in green and brown too, 
i made them from this as template and my BIGDOOR journey began.


THANKS TO THE PERSON WHO MADE BIGDOORC as it inspirated me to make this WAD file.


BDR1282W (The gray 256 pixel wide BIGDOOR) included in my WAD file is BIGDOORC 
with differences here and there to match the other BIGDOORS i had made.


The big tileable BIGDOORS are made of three parts. A left, center and right part.

The naming scheme of these is following:

BD1281ZL

"BD" for BIGDOOR, "128" for its height, "1" for brown, "Z" for 512/768 wide doors,
and "L" for left part.

"2" stands for gray
"3" stands for green

"Y" stands for 384/576 wide doors
"X" stands for 320 wide doors
"W" stands for 256 wide doors



In the "32in24-15 Tex" ressource pack i found a texture named COMPVENT.
That was the template for the included CMPVEN/CMPVN variants.

And in "32in25-25 Tex" ressource i found a texture named MIDFENC2.
I made height variants from 64 to 192 pixels in 16 pixel steps.
Originally this texture seems to be from Espi. 
RIP Espi, your Suspended in Dusk is great.


The COMPSER1 and COMPSER2 textures are made from photos of server-racks and fit
in COMPTALL style frames.


The monitor/screen textures are collections of various parts of textures from 
texturepacks i have found at "www.doomworld.com/afterglow/textures/" 
and were merged by me into COMPTALL style frames or monitor frames,
that i have them in one place to use.


The REACAS textures were made with a texture named REACASK as template from the
Eternity Engine map pack "Caverns of Darkness".

For those who want 32x32 and 16x16 pixels crate textures in brown,
i added two modified CRATELIT and CRATINY textures.


Somewhere long time ago i found a PLAT1 texture in 200 pixels height.
I really don't know anymore where i got this.
Because i have often the problem that the standard 128 pixel height version does
not fit correct,
so i made from this 200 pixel variant and the original PLAT1 variants of
112, 144, 160, 176 and 192 pixels height platform textures.


If someone, i did not know, is the creator of parts of this texture pack,
let me know and i will name you here.


Have fun with it.
