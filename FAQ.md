# Frequently Asked Questions

In case any doomers ask, I assume the following questions, answer both assumes & new as all as I can.

## Why make this mod?

Joel is trying, just for fun. Which turns out he could use this to write his personal things to be dug hundreds of years later, about similar year as with Doom & another century after Zenless Zone Zero.

## Is this Compatible with Mod XYZ?

Yes. Infact, this Mod PK3 is designed to test those TCs you are about to try. To name a few:

- Brutal Doom
- ~~Project Brutality~~ (reduce your GZDoom version first!) (oh no! the DoomEdNum MAPINFO, ZScript Actor, etc. are only on the latest?!)
- Furdoom
- H
- etc. TC

If your mod crashes the game, check if you loaded other mods correctly. Try loading just the target mod & this mod PK3. carefully watch the logs. If all fails, feel free to create issue complete with detailed reproduction steps.

## Is this compatible with ID24?

Yes. We have added & prepared ID24 capabilities. There are now enemies to test & decoration things you can view & ponder. However right now as of March 2025, the Freedom's coverage for ID24 (called FD24) is currently under heavy WIP & has no alpha release yet.

- [Topic about FD24 on Doomworld](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/146968-fd24-free-replacement-for-id24reswad/)
- [Google Spreadsheet listing the asset coverage progress](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VjQF4WgOOVSQ5Wy1SPwLTJg_ZVsn2QIqYTki4lrqFjk/edit?usp=sharing)

For now therefore, you can use [id24dec](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/147764-actors-id24-to-gzdoom-port/) & [id24res (**PAID**)](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/) itself to start testing.

Until this all done, **ID24 will not appear in Mboh Adventure Megawad**.

## Why exclusively designed for Freedoom?

We accidentally chose textures that turns out Freedom exclusive. Since there are alot of the linedefs & sectors with those texture, we are unable to turn back anymore. 
And also the incentive considering the available numbers of texture Freedom provides that combines replacement from Doom to Final Doom together, locks the deal.

So, Congratulations to fraggle et all. You've OutPizza'd the Hut every Classic Doom IWADs combined down to the last before Legacy of Rust. 
This is not sarcastic appreciation. We are indeed looking for ways if Doom should've been available to everyone no matter how personal or financingly people conditions are, when id did Source Code the game itself but the IWAD.

## Is this work on DeltaTouch?

Yes. Choose the latest GZDoom version on the left cogwheel by the GZDoom selection, which in this case: `v4.14`.

[Select GZDoom option](/src/screenshot/delta-touch-how1.png)
[choose latest](/src/screenshot/delta-touch-how2.png)

Unfortunately, if your sparsdated DeltaTouch does not have `v4.14`, then you must beg & pre-gift your parents so they insert credit card online (risk stolen by Google) to download Delta Touch again, legit.  
Also, it is highly likely that ask for voucher no longer works since people have been abusing it. 

Note, that since certain version DeltaTouch has DRM. You must first connect to internet one last time to download license from the Google Play you bought this from.

I encourage everyone who has expertise to take revenge against this practice, by continuing FreeDoom APK, & port latest & greatest Source ports to Android. You may create Issue linking to F-droid, IzzyDroid, Google Play, etc. & the package name of the source ports.

> Caliborn: Apparently, Open Source licenses that do not catch caveats like this, is a double edged sword.

## Is this work on Source Port XYZ?

Sorry, it only works on GZDoom since v4.14.0 (& derivatives based on this) onward. Which means, unfortunately Zandronum does not work (due to the functions used available only on the latest GZDoom).

## Why target GZDoom when since there is no POC License that forbids this poopflame, they're all toxic?

If in some personal reason you had beef with anybody involved within ZDoom as a whole, feel free to make yourself source port that's as awesome as (or better than) GZDoom.  
While unfortunately we cannot cease the target due to already done just to get there, we may still consider so by the next endeavour.

> [!NOTE]
> Joel also has auto-beef of this all since scratch as he found deeper. For clarification, he already has suffered over 75 mental corruptions after being betrayed by his former friends. By this point, people who just had 10 had turned into *Ethereal* in ZZZ a.k.a. *Former Human* in Doom a.k.a. *Zombies* in Freedoom.

Unfortunately, it happened that for Modded Doom sub rabbit hole, the Source Port designed for it was GZDoom & derivatives. Perkedel, DNB, & affiliates were left with no choice but start anyway just to get Joel's personal mission done until he can move on to the next endeavour leave this just another hell behind, 
who know is one of his next dream.

Funny story also, Godot went... yeah. Other ways though, nothing the same, but still hell.

## The Source Port XYZ is capable enough tho!

Again, At the time of making this Mod PK3 here in 2025, Only GZDoom provides much needed feature to fill in those combination features & extra bells and whistles.

## You're not staying here right? Please do not.

Yes. DNB was only given contract of this endeavour for short time. After Joel has no order, we will leave soon. We should've expected, as both with Doom I + II & Freedoom, the hell is also competing against Heaven to go to earth also.

## Is this work in Winlator?

We have yet tested this, but in theory, it should work, albeit depending on your phone, performance varies to the left. Chance of this causing Matot / Brick should also be slimmer since this is farcry from Crysis.
Hey, you also have the ability to Slade & Ultimate Doombuilder there as well, All in one Android yey!

## Is this work on OS ABCDEFG?

Depends on the existence of the source port on that OS.

GZDoom is available on Windows, Linux, & macOS. For Android, buy DeltaTouch on Google Play (existing sparsdats no longer work since this Mod PK3 runs only on since v4.14 onward).

## Does this work with Gamepad

Yes. albeit with terrible support, in this GZDoom as of 2025 (no proper keybind assignment etc.). Since this is First Person gameplay, we personally recommend using Mouse & Keyboard.

## Why the music sounds like a toy?

This is because since the beginning of Doom, one of the earliest music device was MIDI Synths, among others. Full Audio Codec weren't so common during that early stage of gaming on a computer, therefore this is what they have.

The Classic Doom culture is also why there's still MIDI BGMing to this day. using MIDI is very simple & light. You are only distributing a sheet music, how the robot should play the music 1 to 1, unlike with Audio (MP3, FLAC, OGG, etc.) where it's all Wave & so heavy.

Of course, GZDoom now supports Audio music, but it's less prefered for this Doom context. Well, It's possible.

Since MIDI is not audio, only instruction, you can bring your own best of the best synth & it 180 degree change the whole world how is the MIDI sounds like.

## Why is the sound feels like 90s radio?

Again, with the early days of Doom & gaming on PC overall, modern audio formats are still at the infancy. This results that id & friends have to find way to atleast have audio, for the setup that has the soundcard for it.

If you'd like to hear High Quality sound, there are serveral Asset Replacement mods you can try:

- [Sound Bulb](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/110822-doom-sound-bulb-hd-sounds-that-stay-true-to-the-original/) or [Here](https://www.moddb.com/mods/brutal-doom/addons/doom-sound-bulb-20-high-quality-sound-pack)
- [Perkristian's High Quality SFX](https://www.perkristian.net/game_doom-sfx.shtml)

## It's lagging!

GZDoom while provides the most flexibility, unfortunately suffers from performance issues way less present on other Vanilla targeted source ports. This is unfortunately not something we can resolve.  
We also tried our best to avoid building heavy slaughterion on any of our megawads here, and only do so at a much smaller amount, if we had to, as few as cases as possible.

Workaround is, to not load too many Mods, & reduce your graphic settings down to the bare minimum enough to aleviate lags.

Also, it is best to bank up your money as enough as possible to replace your Android phone with Build your own PC.

## No Demo?

Due to the coding structure since ZDoom where this has been now with GZDoom today, at this point it's no longer the same vanilla used to be. As the result, demo will always desync if attempted to be played, and when every new version of GZDoom somewhere.

This is because on how Demo Format is with Doom. It only records input.

We wish Demos are recorded by full motions, not just inputs, & based on that recorded motions, like Blender animation timeline.

Vanilla unmodified source ports that does not heavily modify physics will have Demos support.
