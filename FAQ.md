# Frequently Asked Questions

In case any doomers ask, I assume the following questions, answer both assumes & new as all as I can.

## Is this Compatible with Mod XYZ?

Yes. This Mod PK3 is designed to test those TCs you are about to try. To name a few:

- Brutal Doom
- Project Brutality (reduce your GZDoom version first!)
- Furdoom
- H
- etc. TC

If your mod crashes the game, check if you loaded other mods correctly. Try loading just the target mod & this mod PK3. carefully watch the logs. If all fails, feel free to create issue complete with detailed reproduction steps.

## Is this work on DeltaTouch?

Yes. Choose the latest GZDoom version on the left cogwheel by the GZDoom selection, which in this case: `v4.14`.

Unfortunately, if your sparsdated DeltaTouch does not have `v4.14`, then you must beg & pre-gift your parents so they insert credit card online (risk stolen by Google) to download Delta Touch again, legit.  
Also, it is highly likely ask for voucher no longer works since people have been abusing it. 

Note, that since certain version DeltaTouch has DRM. You must first connect to internet one last time to download license from the Google Play you bought this from.

I encourage everyone who has expertise to take revenge against this practice, by continuing FreeDoom APK, & port latest & greatest Source ports to Android. You may create Issue linking to F-droid, IzzyDroid, Google Play, etc. & the package name of the source ports.
