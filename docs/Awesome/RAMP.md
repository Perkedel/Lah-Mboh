# RAMP TerraWAD Collections

Here are TerraWADs of RAMP led by DavidXNewton. Be careful, **they're HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE** in storage usage! If you lag, either it's on your spec, or you loaded a mod that lags it all out. Or both. Anyway inevitable, you know GZDoom's trouble right?

## What is this?

RAMP (Rabbit All comer Mapping Project) is a TerraWAD consisting of maps made by communities. Every year it held (usually around first quarter), community can upload every single type of DOOM maps. Whatever style, hard or just a demoscene, all welcome. Noob to Pro, also welcome. You succ at mapping? welcome! You pro at mapping? same wecome! Do anything you want to get it in. That is, if the map is playable stably & doesn't crash the DOOM itself of course. Also mind the space usage coz there's also a limit obviously as you gotta mind Doomer's disks coz this TerraWAD means **HUUUUUUUGE!**.

RAMP was inspired from [TerminusEst13's DUMP (Doom Upstart Mapping Project)](https://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&t=52276), a TerraWAD that started it all.
