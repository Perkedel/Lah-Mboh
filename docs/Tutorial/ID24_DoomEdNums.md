> Copied from [purged post](https://web.archive.org/web/20250407133807/https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/152338-id24-things-doomednums/)

The followings are DoomEdNums for ID24 if you'd like to add ID24 experience with your map.

## Overall

### Weapons

- [Calamity Blade](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Calamity_blade). -28620. Shoots lines of flame, & causes continous DMG towards target as its flame swipes them.
- [Incinerator](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Incinerator). -28619. Flame thrower, watchout its emited flame!
- [Fuel Can (small)](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Fuel_can). -28622. Smaller ammo for Calamity & Incinerator
- [Fuel Tank (big)](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Fuel_tank). -28621. Larger ammo for Calamity & Incinerator
 
### Monsters

- [Banshee](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Banshee). -28671 (3008 in ID24 Decorate)
- [Vassago](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Vassago). -28668 (3011 in ID24 Decorate). It's 2 S', not 1 (vasago)!
- [Mindweaver](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Mindweaver). -28670 (3009 in ID24 Decorate). Looks like Arachnotron, but weaker than Arachnotron & uses Chaingun like Spider Mastermind instead of Plasma gun.
- [Ghoul](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Ghoul_(Legacy_of_Rust)). -28672 (3007 in ID24 Decorate). Beta Lost Soul and shoots energy pellet instead of fly crash towards you
- [Shocktrooper](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Shocktrooper). -28669 (3010 in ID24 Decorate). Evil Marine. When killed, its head decaps with interupted huge pain scream.
- [Tyrant](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Tyrant_(Legacy_of_Rust)). -28667, -28666, -28665 (3012 in ID24 Decorate). Cyberdemon before the cybernetics
 
### Friendly

- [Helper Dog](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Helper_dog). 888. (BONUS) MBF21's sample of Friendly Monster AI. This intrestingly is covered by the Source Port itself (since the fact the feature comes from the [Marine's Best Friend](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/MBF) Source Port itself) rather than the IWADs, as you can see inside the internal PK3 of the e.g. GZDoom (gzdoom.pk3) that has this Thing, including its sprites. There is a `whistle` command ([sauces in Trivia](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Helper_dog), [Eternity Engine](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Eternity_Engine)) in Eternity Engine you can try to call the dogs (it's a tribute!).

## Table from Gez

> [!TIP]
> Gez: If you don't like negative numbers, you can use positive values instead. This is because the same value can interpreted as a signed or an unsigned integer. The hexadecimal representation is the same anyway, as hex values do not have signs. Here's the big ol' table.

> [!TIP]
> some Things without DoomEdNums does not mean does not exist. It's just has no editor number (like other some DoomEdNumless built-in Things), since they are e.g. a particle what aren't meant to be placed as a init spawn in a map.

## Extras

- [Obsidian Plauge's ID24 Decorate](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/147764-actors-id24-to-gzdoom-port/). Mapper's resource PWAD & Gameplay PWAD to add ID24 monster. Just load the id24res.wad alongside it.
- [Rum & Raisin Doom boomtest.wad](https://github.com/GooberMan/rum-and-raisin-doom/blob/master/wads/boomtest.wad). Test MBF21! You can load this wad locally with DOOM I + II.
- [DOOM I + II](https://web.archive.org/web/20250407133807/https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/). Legacy of Rust was the newest PWAD that premieres ID24.
- [Lah-Mboh?](https://web.archive.org/web/20250407133807/https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/151743-gzdoom-zscript-id24-lah-mboh-test-map-megawads/). Test ID24 in GZDoom & derivatives (use above ID24 Decorate & id24res.wad).

## Placements

![Open chosen Thing properties with right click on your selected Thing](/src/screenshot/type_manual_id24.png)  
![Manually type the number you desire according to above table](/src/screenshot/type_manual_id24-2.png)  

## Addendum
As of now, there is no such format config that supports ID24. You can simply load the necessary PWADs & id24res.wad. Since assuming you used ID24 Decorate, you should see the ID24 monsters there in the list.

However, for Weapons, you will need to manually type its DoomEdNum manually. You will also won't see how does it looks like in the editor & instead see Question Mark Red Ball. You can ignore this, and GZDoom since v4.13 above (with id24res.wad or latest Freedoom with FD24 (someday in the future) loaded) will loads your ID24 weapons fine.

Please note, **ID24 Decorate may not compatible with supposed DoomEdNum of the actual ID24!**. In order for many KEX DOOM ID24 supported mods (including boomtest.wad) to work, the monsters should also use those minus Type numbers as well! Let's wait until GZDoom covers those numbers too after the weapons.
