# How to mostly not lost in Frag Deathmatch & other competitive multiplayer games

Uh... I don't play competitive multiplayer much. So, based on [*How to Mostly Not Die*](/docs/Tutorial/HowToMostlyNotDie.md), 
Here are few extension tips you can follow (as much as I know):

## Use High Hertz Display!

Yeah. This idea of competitive multiplayer is basically pay to win, irl no matter how humble this particular video game already been.

Who's fast, wins. So buy greatest & latest monitor you can buy. Well uh.. I get it. Perhaps Chinese manufactures like Skyworth got you covered.

See GTID YouTube channels for news about computer monitors & various technologies.

And don't forget, go to your advanced display setting, so the Hertz mode goes to the highest your monitor can be.

## Use best of the best mouse

With HUGE polling rate, HUGE in everything good. Anything that makes your Aim fast & accurate.

## Disable Mouse Acceleration!

In your mouse setting of your system setting, **you must completely disable acceleration!** This feature is for terrible mouse on a casual setting and tight desk. Well, not for gaming. This can cause unpredictable movement hence fatal inaccuracies, because faster you move the mouse, faster the cursor gonna be.

So no, Disable it all, even on above casual settings.

## Also best of the best keyboard.

Which switches that has short enough travel, short in-response time & range. Typically this is a Cherry-MX Red & similar. It's a linear clickless switch with relatively short travel time.

Also, ask for pre-lubrication if available.

## Constrain the FPS just 10 Hz higher than your monitor's

Constraining FPS, claimed to improve perfomance by avoiding unecessary frame generations. This claimed to ensure most lags due to unexpected hiccup & overworking cramps, to be aleviated as much as possible.

## Train your aims & movements!

Such as

- Left Right Left Right. Aim left right left right to the target to train your accuracy. Configure your peripherals well, & build this muscle memory based on it so by the game, you have this config memory on your muscles and obtains best headshooting experiences. 
- Evade!. Learn how the strafing in this particular IWAD & Source Port works. How fast do you move with this, so you can coordinate shot evasion well.

## Know the weapons & classes (characters) in the game.

Because as with regular & enemies, there are again: Projectiles & Hitscans. Each IWAD / IPK3 / PCK / or other games pretty much have different way how those weapons are programmed.  
There are ones with only projectiles.  
Another only hitscans like Valorant I think.  
etc etc.

Sometimes, it's because different class instead, your weapon would be different. Again, Projectiles or Hitscan, you learn them. Like.. in Team Fortress.

And another case, There is a class that does not attack but heals & provides effects e.g.

Sometimes also, classes are just skins, so it's just weapon. Such as [Cube 2: Sauerbraten](http://sauerbraten.org/), or regular Fortnite modes, other whatever. And hence just focus on obtaining whatever weapon you see & use it best you can.

## Focus fragging!

With whatever weapons you have, if you are in Frag modes of multiplayer, then.. **Just frag!**, that's all. With whatever you're holding on, shoot as fast as you can. If necessary, shower them all until you frag.

& if the weapon is lagging, find time to change to a faster ones, quickly while be aware around you, and frag again.

## Sportmanship, Sportmanship, SPORTIVITAS!!

As always, every competitive multiplayer games, wants it digital, or real life, requires sportmanship.

Accept defeat very well, because this is just a game, you know.., [***why you heff to be maed?***](https://youtu.be/xzpndHtdl9A). [Yeah](https://youtu.be/-Ns14hRqwY8)

So, cheating in this competitive context, even in my personal view, just.. cringe. You don't get anything right? Why cheat? It's somebody houses just so you know. Just don't crash the party, I beg you. Everyone wants to play.

Yeah if you succ at it, play something else I guess, maybe fragging isn't your thing? Okay, fine. The world's isn't wide anymore as it used to be, I have ordered my people to rewide it again with many more games. I hope it works.
