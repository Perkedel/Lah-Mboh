# How to mostly not die in DOOM, Casual Compatible

Playing DOOM & related is very easy! As long as you know what the enemies are, the surroundings, and few other things, 
you should be able to survive & keep engaging your gameplay until the end of the episode or whole megawad.

## Learn your locomotives of your avatar / player well!

Here in DOOM, you should have basically:

- Movement WASD. Front, Back, Strafe Left, & Strafe Right. Using Left hand quad-way movement buttons, which are `WASD`.
- Interaction. Using a left index finger button right beside your movement, which in this case: `E`.
- Look. Using your mouse. If you somehow ~~a false purist or~~ don't have any pointing system, the keboard arrows should suffice. Of course, it feels like Right Analog Stick & in FPS, is a whole another nightmare to control.
- Both Shoot buttons. In your mouse, where `primary button` is **main fire** & the `secondary button` an **alternative fire**.

That's all. But there are other buttons for Modern DOOM experiences you should also make sure or configure for later

- Jump. Using left thumb buttons which this case: `Space`.
- Duck / Crouch. Using leftmost left pinky button which in this case: `Left Ctrl`. ~~Although, this cause fatigue, so maybe you can use `Left Shift` instead.~~
- Sneak. By default, you always run (CVAR always run set to ON). Using left pinky button which in this case: `Left Shift`.
- Zoom / Some Action. using `Middle Mouse Button` OR Ring Finger button (`Q` like Duke Nukem Mighty Foot / Kick)
- Inventory. Inventory Navigation (`[` & `]` for left & right) & Activations (`Return / Enter`)!
- Reload. Using secondary left index button, which in this case: `R`.
- Extra Actions. Buttons that are Third Index Finger (`F`), Right Thumb 1 (`Mouse Button Back`), Right Thumb 2 (`Mouse Button Forward`)
- Trading. Special Extra Button used to open Shop menu like in Counter Strike, which usually `B` as in *Buy*.

## Know the enemy types

There are serveral types of enemies. Each has different way of attacks. But in here, most important type you should classify are: Hitscan & Projectiles.

The **Hitscan** enemies should be targeted first. Any encounter should redirect first to this guys. You cannot dodge this kind of attack, so that's why.

**Highest damage** especially, must go first.

And finally, **fastest attack rate** go first.

What are the difference?

### Hitscan

The enemy weapon bullet goes instantly to the target like an infinite speed laser. 
This is typical of lazy gun attack on many Game Engine tutorials, and its result is very instant & very undodgeable.

examples:

- Former Sergeant / Shotgun guy. Wields shotgun, and fires large DMG closer they are to you. Drops Shotgun itself. Perfect for general, just be brave.
- Chaingunner / Minigun guy. Wields rapid fire pistol. While fires the same pistol ammo, it is frustrating as this gun fires really fast, causing repeated small but so many DMGs. Drops Minigun itself, and you can fire at many enemies repeatedly to repeatedly stun them, effectively killing them. Perfect for hordes.
- Spider Mastermind / Large Technospider. Wields Minigun. Same as chaingunner but never drops the gun itself unfortunately.

### Projectile

The enemy spawns a flying bullet that usually goes slower but usually assigned with large amount of DMG. 
This kind of attack is on the advanced tutorial of many Game Engine tutorials, and involves creating a brand new object (in DOOM called Thing) as an Fire Orb or Missile.  
It results very slow & dodgeable. Of course, failure of dodging gives satisfying DMGs

examples:

- Imp / Serpentipede. Fires a flame orb.
- Arachnotron / Technospider. Fires a green flame orb like a plasma
- Cyberdemon / Assault tripod. Has missile on his hand. Unfortunately, you cannot amputate his hand (to acquire his missiles), because he explode to dust when he dies. Wanna make the mod to keep that from happening? it's possible in DEH tho, by make him drop Rocket Launcher?

## Strafe to dodge!

You do not have shield to defend yourself (unless you installed shield mod) against hordes of bullets & missiles. But, since your DOOM player is very fast & agile, you can move sideways to dodge their projectiles.

Also, You can eventually kill Cyberdemon / Assault tripod just by circling arround and focus aiming & shooting that guy, with this method, **very easy**. All you need, is to coordinate both hands well, have a good mouse & keyboards, et voila.

Extra tips! Both mouse buttons should atleast be infrared hall effect based, or anything that does not wear for repeated use in centuries. Mouse button that wears messes up your click (such as double click in single).

## Don't screw up these technics!

Now, you understand the basic of agility? Now go. Don't screw it up. Medipacks & Armors maxes at 100, with bonuses accumulates up to 200. Soulsphere & Megasphere got you 100 HP uncapped & 200 HP 200 Armor respectively, but that's rare.

## Preserve your HP, Armor, & powerups

Now you know the limitation, it's recommended to pick those items sparingly, except bonuses which you should collect anyways if you involve 100% items gameplay.

For radiation floor (Nukage), avoid taking all of the radiation protective suits at once. This suit does not count towards completition, and who knows you may need one again to reexplore.

Avoid taking all megaspheres around rapidly at once, because you have critical MAX of 200 HP & Armor. Unless you want 100% item, & you're pro, well go ahead I guess.

In total for powerups, Take only the repeat powerups when each going to run out. So, say Invulnerability. It's blinking! Go take it again. Don't take the same one immediately before these effect waning off.

Berserk effect happens to last whole level apparently. This also restores 100 HP as well.

## Know your weapon types!

Understand the type of weapons you have, importantly also.

Here in DOOM, you have:

- Pistol
- Pump Action Shotgun.
- Double Barreled Shotgun (since DOOM II only). Called Super Shotgun (DOOM) / Double Barreled Shotgun (Freedoom)
- Pistol but rapid fire. Called Chaingun (DOOM) / Minigun (Freedoom)
- Rocket Launcher. Called Rocket Launcher (DOOM) / Missile Launcher (Freedoom). Careful, its explosion also DMG yourself!
- Plasma gun. Uses energy batteries as the ammo.
- Giant Plasma launcher that DMG enemies as its orb explodes, and does not DMG yourself. Called BFG 9000 (DOOM) / SKAG 1337 (Freedoom). Big Fucking Gun Nine Thousand / Super Kick Ass Gun Leet

I personally use Double Barreled Shotgun (Super Shotgun) in general. If there's no, there's already regular pump shotgun (Shotgun).  
For defeating Cyberdemon & other large enemies, I use Giant Plasma Launcher (BFG 9000 / SKAG 1337). If the energy out, Rocket Launcher.
