# How to Cloud Storage

> [!CAUTION]
> Using generic cloud storage is not recommended & absolutely discouraged since they are usually do not last long 
> & shared links may expire all of the sudden, despite the best option you've picked.  
> You also have storage limit to how much you can store there, & expansions purchase are never permanent (i.e. subscriptions).  
> Additionally, many Cloud Storage sharing page are typically not Archive compatible (uncrawable due to complex *security* system), hence if it's gone, **it's gone.**
