# DOOM I + II Achievement how to

## Disclaimer

- **You cannot use Mods to get achievements**, unlike with Duke Nukem 3D World Tour. Wtf, Bethesda?! argh whatevea.

## End Screens

- DOOM
- DOOM II
- TNT: Plutonia Experiment
- TNT: Evilution
- Master Levels for DOOM II
- No rest for the Living
- SIGIL I
- Legacy of Rust

Simply:

- Use `Select level` on your `New Game`.
- Easiest difficulty (`I'm too young to die`)
- Start at its end of level
    - structures like `ExMy` will be its one before the last. e.g., there are 9 in this `E` & there are 4 episodes, so get to `E4M8`.
    - structures like `MAPXY` will be its two before the last. e.g., there are 32 maps, so go to `MAP30`
    - DOOM is on `E3M8` because that was the last before the Ultimate. If that doesn't work, then `E4M8`. I forgor which one did I had one at.
    - DOOM II, Plutonia, & Evilution are on `MAP30`.
    - [SIGIL I is on `E5M8` (Halls of Perdition)](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/SIGIL)
    - [No Rest for the living final level is at `8` (Tomb of Malevolence)](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/No_Rest_for_the_Living)
    - [Master Level is on `20` (Mephisto's Maosoleum)](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Master_Levels_for_Doom_II)
    - Bethesda yess finally added SIGIL II, **but still forgot to add end screen achievement for it**. Maybe it's already baked when SIGIL II indeed too late for it that time? Umm, could be fixed right?
