# DOOM I + II Achievement how to

## Disclaimer

- **You cannot use Mods to get achievements**, unlike with Duke Nukem 3D World Tour ([map for it](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2359886578)). Wtf, Bethesda?! argh whatevea.

## End Screens

- DOOM
- DOOM II
- TNT: Plutonia Experiment
- TNT: Evilution
- Master Levels for DOOM II
- No rest for the Living
- SIGIL I
- Legacy of Rust

Simply:

- Use `Select level` on your `New Game`.
- Easiest difficulty (`I'm too young to die`)
- Start at its end of level
    - structures like `ExMy` will be its one before the last. e.g., there are 9 in this `E` & there are 4 episodes, so get to `E4M8`.
    - structures like `MAPXY` will be its two before the last. e.g., there are 32 maps, so go to `MAP30`
    - DOOM is on `E3M8` because that was the last before the Ultimate. If that doesn't work, then `E4M8`. I forgor which one did I had one at.
    - DOOM II, Plutonia, & Evilution are on `MAP30`.
    - [SIGIL I is on `E5M8` (Halls of Perdition)](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/SIGIL)
    - [No Rest for the living final level is at `8` (Tomb of Malevolence)](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/No_Rest_for_the_Living)
    - [Master Level is on `20` (Mephisto's Maosoleum)](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Master_Levels_for_Doom_II)
    - Bethesda yess finally added SIGIL II, **but still forgot to add end screen achievement for it**. Maybe it's already baked when SIGIL II indeed too late for it that time? Umm, could be fixed right?

## Struggle-a-tons

- An Important Looking Door (First time found Secret). e.g., in DOOM E1M1, there is a button in armor room, right pillar. Once pressed, immediately go to the open door right by where you spawn. Re-enter back another hallway you saw.
- Not So Friendly Fire (Cause an Infight & that Enemy killed another one). Best to do this with lots of varied (not similar) Enemies around you. Alert & lure them & they should *accidentally* hit one another, causing Infight.
- Hoarder (Level Complete with 100% Items). Best to do this on any first level of any built-in WADs, such as DOOM with E1M1. Collect those all.
- Burning Out of Control (Level Complete with 100% Kills, 100% Items, & 100% Secrets). Best to do this on any first level of any built-in WADs, such as DOOM with E1M1. Collect & kill all.
- Groovy (3 Enemies at once with Shotgun (or Super Shotgun?))
- Clean Slate (Level Complete 100% Kills HMP+ (Hurt me Plenty or higher))
- Timing is Everything (2 Enemies by barrel explosion). Best to do this in DOOM II Barrels O' Fun (MAP23)
- Skeet Shooting (4 Enemies at once with Super Shotgun)
- Overkill (Just 1 Enemy with BFG9000, no more no less)
- Cookin' With Plasma (5 Enemies continuous in 5 second window with Plasma Riffle)
- Overprepared (Level Complete with 200% HP & 200% Armor)
- Bowling for Gibs (3+ Enemies Gib with Rocket)
- Heavenly Joy (200 Enemies Chaingunned consecutively no change weapon)
- A Man & a Half (20 Enemies Berserk Punch-kill in a single level)
- Guns Are For Wusses (25 Enemies Punch-kill in a single level)
- Shoot It Until It Dies (Finish a Cyberdemon with Pistol). Wound a Cyberdemon, so you can finish it off with your Pistol
- Screen Wipe (50 Enemies in single Calamity Blade). Best to do this on the Legacy of Rust slaughter maps where there's a whole lots of Imps rising from the bowl
- Kill It With Fire (30 Spider type Enemies Incinerated with Incinerator)
- Untouchable (8 Level Completes in row under par time deathless UV+ (Ultra Violence or higher))
- The Only Thing They Fear Is You (100% Kills in a level Damageless UV+ (Ultra Violence or higher))
- More Like a Dream (Level Complete in Nightmare). Best to do this on DOOM E1M1 or DOOM II MAP01, & roll with it through skips available, don't die.
- Doormat (Close door while a Corpse in the door). This requires a coincidence, like you did in Duke Nukem 3D.
