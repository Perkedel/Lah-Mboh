### Is it normal to use Agentic helpers?

Personally, It should be kinda fine. As long as you don't use it to cheat like:

> Hey, make this for me. Here instruction. 

Nu uh! That's not how it works. That mean you have no idea what you're doing.  
To sculpt a statue, you shall understand & feel its process. How's the curve, & the trajectory it should be from start to end.

The use of these agents & their autocompletion shall only be useful as a limb that improves your sculpting efficiency, not the brain.
