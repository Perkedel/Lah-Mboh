how this price feels like to me, converting perspective just for you in US Dollar. So many stuffs when sold internationally, it'll be in `US$`, sometimes it's in European Continents' (`Euro`, `Pounsterling`, etc.).  
As a person live in Indonesia, we feel like such currency in price would feel like that it's expensive going here. I'll give you example how should that feels like

## JOELwindows7's

### The American Dollar

E.g., if a stuff costs me say **US$ 15.00**, as of around 2025, that would become IDR 200k somewhere around.

Converting how it feels like to you in United State, **it feels like US$200**. Yeah, our currency is that weak!

Another example, Right now big games been about **US$ 70s**. On Steam therefore, this can cause price to become from about **IDR 800K, up to IDR 1 Million & counting.**. You can see, that feels like I'm paying a grand, as that **feels like US$ 900 to US$ 1000 & up**. Oh yeah, how do you feel if a copy of Mortal Kombat 1 Standard distribution costs you 1 Grand?

### The European Coins

Even worse for things priced in Europe. as of 2025, the European coins, especially Euro (whole EU) & Poundsterling (UK) is a bit stronger than USD. So, say it's **15 Euro**. Well I've converted it (2025-06-15), it's IDR 281.625,00 (around 300K round it up).

Yep, **it feels like US$ 300, or 200 Euro**.

## Other Attempted Recovered Witnesses

### Canadian Milk bags

If I was not wrong, as people use Canadian culture of milk bags as the comparison object against a pricings, A copy of DOOM Eternal said to cost right about 31s of Normal sized ones.

To bring you this context, Canadian milk is in plastic sealed bag, unlike in US with plastic jug, or even UK in glass bottle. They cost it this, so that's where it wraps up.

Speaking of compared by livestock objects, you gotta stop smoking, ***in my opinion*** (& medical "*opinion*" (fact btw)). As a never smoke person, I found that you can compare a stick costs you same like a chicken egg. Replace whole that your life slowly eventually, and you'll be eating healthy instead. **NO wait, that's a parable**, don't stack too much protein coz LDL may appear instead. What I say is, **you could've subscribe to a much healthier option**. If a Gym Membership is too extreme (coz admit, I also not into sort of this and would even call it bullshit in my opinion unless it's a VR arcade something), **then you can try game or film subscriptions**. You'll still be stupid as heck but at least don't go to Hell too early (especially because you broke your body with lung cancers), and have a chance to repent so you can go to Heaven, iyey! Oh, or maybe some food subscriptions, you have it there right? Just microwave it, and eat healthy!  
Smoking is yes subscription, but this is considered worst waste of money, coz you're destroying yourself the fastest & suffermost.  
Futhermore, you could enjoy private time of smoking since you're disturbing one anyway so your choice of space becomes limited, but what if suddenly there's a Fire Alarm you didn't know it's there? You bastard! I thought the building is on fire, when it turns out it was fucking you!! You smoked in a hotel, and you stupid low IQ! All rooms have those fucking domes on the ceiling that detects smoke & heat! As well as metalic spiky thingy that if you provoke it emits hot water like when you press `Q` on fire hydrant, called Sprinkler. [I did happened](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/-Dy_9YEpyIM), A person during Haj contract **started a cigarette in his hotel room**, triggering the smoke dome on the ceiling. Everyone panik, because the building announce there's a fire. Yep, it was that fucking idiot person there.
