# Human Resource Quotience

How it feels like to be qualified as low SDM (SDM Rendah / low quality Human Resource rating)? It feels terrible right? Me too! But then, only by accepting fate then where's the fun in that? There has to be the advantage of being Low SDM. Because turns out way too high SDM is not good either, even let's all 100% of the people living around you are also extremely high SDM. That's basically a Program, not SOUL.

It gotta be a copium right? Obviously. But have you realized that there are other troubles that you should take care of once you're done with yours? What's the correct way to handle those? Remember, that laws do not read SOUL. It only knows justice. Knows only the right, even tho it will suffers others who even is a good side. This is way more complicated that natural selection. You do what you think is right, and to keep your friend, and possibly strangers, do it for those, out of comfort zones.

The following, is the table of HR quotience, based on your habit & what would the judgement we think would say
