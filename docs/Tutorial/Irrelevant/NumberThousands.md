# How to Read Numbers

It's easy to read a value number, thanks to a universal standandard that defines ways of reading float or integer value in a variable.

## Real

Reading real number goes like this:

### One To Hundreds

- 1 = Ones  
- 10 = Tens  
- 100 = Hundreds

Except number by One Tens (10-19) in most languages, reading number is as easy as mentioning the leftmost followed by the next. Make note also in languages like English, Hundreds may becomes a virtual section that holds right other as a virtual subsection. E.g.:

- 1 = One
- 11 = Eleven. This guy is exclusive in English and some more. If you ask for Indonesian (Sebelas), We consider that not having exclusive, since `Se` means One, and `Belas` that along with the others, is One Tens.
- 12 = Twelve. Also exclusive in English. Again, Indonesia (Dua Belas) still had no exclusive forward.
- 13 = Thirteen. By this, just add `teen` which means One Tens after 12. Very easy (Indonesian = Tiga Belas).
- 15 = Fifteen
- 20 = Twenty
- 21 = Twenty One
- 57 = Fifty Seven
- 69 = Sixty Nine üòè
- 100 = One Hundred. Again, in Indonesia is *Seratus*. `Se` is *One of*, `Ratus` is Hundred. Basically, on Ones, Hundred, & Thousand, We abbreviate `Satu` into `Se`.
- 101 = One Hundred One
- 125 = One Hundred Twenty Five
- 256 = Two Hundred Fifty Six
- 314 = Three Hundred, Fourteen. Remember, You have a 300, and then followed by the usual Tens, which is 14. Whatever it is, It's its hundreds followed by rest two following the previous Tens & Elevens rule.

### Thousands, Millions, and forth

Real number sections in most languages will be divided by 3. Therefore, above sections becomes subsections.

- 1 = Ones  
- 1,000 = Thousands  
- 1,000,000 = Millions (1illions Mil = One)  
- 1,000,000,000 = Billions (2illion Bi = Two)  
- 1,000,000,000,000 = Trillions (3illion Tri = Three)   
- 1,000,000,000,000,000 = Quadrillions (4illion Quad = Four)  
- 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 = Pentillions (5illion Penta = Five)
- 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 = Sextillions (6illion Sex = Six)
- 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 = Septillions (7illion Septa = Seven)
- 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 = Octillions (8illion Octa = Eight)
- 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 = Nonillions (9illion Nona = Nine)
- 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 = Decillions (10illion Deca = Ten)
- 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 = Undecillion (11ilion Uno = One in a Tens, Deca = Ten)
- 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 = Dodecillions (12illion Dos = Two in a Tens, Deca = Ten)
- 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 = Tredecillion (13illion Tres = Three in a Tens, Deca = Ten)
- Oh God, what else?

The subsection of it will use those Ones, Tens, & Hundreds. In English, mention the section, followed by the sub section. E.g.:

- 1,000 = One Thousand
- 1,125 = One Thousand One Hundred Twenty Five. Again, follow the rules recursively: The Thousands, The Hundreds, and then the rest two either Tens or an Elevens.
- 1,111 = One Thousand One Hundred Eleven
- 1,525,125 = One Million, Five Hundred twenty five **Thousand**, One Hundred Twenty Five. Do make note, in Indonesia we called it ***Juta***. Not to be confused with ***Miliar*** which means ***Billion***. Watch out!
- 256,256,256 = Two hundred fifty six **Million**, Two hundred fifty six **Thousand**, Two hundred fifty six.
- etc. I'm pretty sure that if you say play Cookie Clicker, you've heard even stranger sections that follows above trillions.

## Decimal

Decimal marks if there is a partial or precission in a value that can't be described enough just by the real number alone. It's exclusively a float feature. In English, it's denoted by `.`, where the precission numbers follows.  
Be mindful, the way it works, that number proceedings if they are say zeros forward, can be ommitted, leaving only its useful numbers just by it. E.g.:

- 1.25 = One point twenty five. It is also same as
- 1.250 = One Point two hundred fifty. and..
- 1.2500 = One point two thousand five hundred. So, if the rest is zero, you can just ommit that. Unless, say there is an *unexpected misprecission* out there..
- 1.2500012 = One point two million Five hundred Thousand twelve.
