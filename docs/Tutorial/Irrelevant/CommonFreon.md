# Common Freons

Here are types of freon commonly found in cooling devices.

([Wikipedia: Freon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freon)) Freon (/ˈfriːɒn/ FREE-on) is a **registered [trademark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trademark)** of the [Chemours Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemours) and generic descriptor for a number of [halocarbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halocarbon) products. They are stable, nonflammable, low toxicity[1](http://www.refrigerants.com/pdf/SDS%20R12.pdf) gases or liquids which have generally been used as refrigerants and as aerosol propellants. They include chlorofluorocarbons and hydrofluorocarbons, both of which cause ozone depletion (although the latter much less so) and contribute to global warming. 'Freon' is the brand name for the refrigerants R-12, R-13B1, R-22, R-410A, R-502, and R-503 manufactured by The Chemours Company. They emit a strong smell similar to [acetone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetone).[2](https://www.hunker.com/12003203/why-does-my-refrigerator-smell-like-nail-polish-remover) Freon has been found to cause damage to human health when inhaled in large amounts. Studies have been conducted in the pursuit to find beneficial reuses for gases under the Freon umbrella as an alternative to disposal of the gas.

## Types of Freon

> [!NOTE]
> Listing only the commonly used Freons found in Air Conditioner, Fridges, and stuffs.  
> For more, see the exhaustive [list of refrigerants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_refrigerants).

- R-32 / HCFC-32 **NEW**, **BEST: AC**. Difluoromethane (CH2F2). Air Conditioner. A newer Freon that should not or lesser to break ozone layer when leaked. Note, that this Freon was found to be Flamable, hmm how much sensitivity tho?. Split ACs these days uses this kind of Freon.
- R-12 / CFC-12 **DEPRECATED**, **BANNED**. Dichlorodifluoromethane (CCl2F2). Air Conditioner. This is a legacy freon from those older AC. These are found breaking ozone layer when leaked onto the air, hence it's no longer supported & fully banned since 2010. There was a sedan that uses this, making it famously portable North Pole that brings its light into its back seats.
- R-22 / HCFC-22 **DEPRECATED**, **BANNED**. Chlorodifluoromethane (CHClF2). Air Conditioner. Also a legacy Freon, and breaks ozone layer too just like R-12.
- R-410A / HFC-410A **FUNDAMENTALS FOR LEGACY**. R-22/152a/124 (53±2/13+.5,-1.5/34±1). Air Conditioner. Actually, it's Puron brand mostly instead. This is for said legacy Air Conditioners that uses R-22 which have been banned since. I lacks Chlorine mixture which is the part that breaks the ozones back. Obviously, this may have some compatiblity issues. Additionally, there was a rumor of this being phased out due to another environmental trouble impacts. This Freon nowadays found to be scarce as another alternative has came below
- R-454B / HFO-454B. R-32/1234yf (68.9%/31.1%). Fridge & Heat Pump. A Freon for chiller boxes. Also can be used to replace those R-410A. Found to have better performance & compatibility compared to R-410A & breaks less the ozone layer when leaked.
- R-134a / HCFC-134a. 1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane (C2H2F4). Air Conditioner (+Automobile). Another popular Freon type.. ish, to replace those R-22 & R-410A. Also lacks Chlorine atom, so breaks less to no amount of ozone layer. Some new HVACs (Mega AC) also use this too.
