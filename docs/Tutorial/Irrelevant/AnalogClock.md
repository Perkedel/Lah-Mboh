Reading Analog is very easy! All you have to do, is watch which hands each point at & use math consts to interpret it.

### Basic (The Analog)

- Long Hand = Minute. What number pointed at **TIMES (\*)** `5` (Const)
- Thin Longest Hand = Second. What number pointed at **TIMES (\*)** `5` (Const)
- Short Hand = Hour. If AM then add zero (i.e. whatever the number is) else if PM then add 12 (the number it is plus 12).

When in AM, and the hour hand touches `12`, the time will immediately goes to **`12:00` in 24h** & **`12:00 PM` in 12h**.

When in PM, and the hour hand touches `12`, the time will immediately goes to **`00:00` in 24h** & **`12:00 AM` in 12h**, Not `24:00`.

### Reading (The Digital)

- 12:00 = Twelve O'clock
- 13:00 / 1:00 PM = Thirteen O'clock / One O'clock PM
- 18:30 / 6:30 PM = Eighteen Thirty Clock / Six Thirty PM. There are some languages that shortens half hour reading, such as in Indonesia, it'll be Setengah Sembilan Belas / Setengah Tujuh Malam. Note that you just say Half followed by the forward clock number, which is 19 / 7. Therefore Half Nineteen / Half Seven PM.

#### AM PM??

The AM denotes before afternoon (12:00 when sun seems to be on very top here), and the PM denotes after that 12 (13:00 until the sun seems went to west here). Then when it touches 12 Midnight (00:00 sun seems to be way underneath us, and we see the moon somewhere), it goes right back to AM until the sun seems to come here again from east.

So AM is sunrise hours (morning, afternoon), PM is sunsetting hours (afternoon, evening, midnight).

The AM PM notation commonly appears only on 12h format. on the 24h format, you can just determine if the hour is either past 12:00, or before it.

### Habbit (Maybe Opinion)

In the west, people usually speaks by the 12h format. Like in Germany even, they just talk the clock without the AM nor PM, and the opponent usually assumes the AM and the PM would be. So let's say `Party at 7`. Understanding this, you can assume that it would be **7 PM / 19:00**. No way 7 AM, what?!

While on the east, some languages will speak by 24h format. You can see that sometimes in Subtitle Bahasa Indonesia, when the character speaks time clock, the subbers usually converts it to 24h format. Maybe confusing for even locals, but it is like this.

I (Indonesian) personally set the format to 24h format. If there is, I use the ISO format whereas it'd be like `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ssss`.

## Military

In Millitary, Clock readings are usually be abbreviated & shortened to make time definition fast & efficient. Very important in every types of commication & dossier briefings. You wanna make sure everyone understand when time would be, fast in a very limited conditions of every kind.

You simply remove the `:` and call it out like reading a Value Number in a Variable, noting the division in the middle.

Also note, Military format is always 24 Hour format. So if they say `05:00`, it always mean 5 AM.

- 12:00 = 1200 Twelve Hundred
- :00 = Hundred, replacing `O' Clock`.
- 06:00 = 0600 Zero Six hundred. Although, ~~the `O'` is not entirely removed, it just got new role~~ No, that gone too.
- 11:30 = 1130 Eleven Hundred Thirty (less `Half Twelve Hundred`)
- 22:45 = 2245 Twenty Two Four Five. Sometimes, you gotta be faster & shorter than ever before.
