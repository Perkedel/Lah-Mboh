# Coping with Microsoft Office on Linux

Various Wine Packagers such as [PlayOnLinux](https://usebottles.com/), [Bottles](https://usebottles.com/), & who knows [Lutris](https://lutris.net/) et communities, etc. may have instructions on how to setup & run Microsoft Office on Linux.

Obviously, this technique not only NOT RECOMMENDED, but extremely unstable.

The following is other ways you could Microsoft Office as your enterprise you were employee of requires it:

## ALternatives

### Online

Your company / institution whose subscribed to Microsoft 365 should have an Online Microsoft Word Webapp. You can simply open up serveral docx files on your company's OneDrive. This is also a way how a Chromebook employee does Microsoft Office, if the company went Microsoft instead of Google (hence Google Docs & Drive).

### APK

[Google Play Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.office.officehubrow)

This is actually not a Linux (because Android is not GNU Linux it seems, & it just uses Linux kernel as the container of the Special Java app which is Android, idk). You can view and edit documents on your phones or tablet. Again, just login to your company's 365 email & you will have access your Company OneDrive & open up & edit files shared by your coleagues.

### Alternate Solutions

- [OnlyOffice](https://www.onlyoffice.com/). [Source Code organization](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE)
- [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download). [Source code organization](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/)
- etc.

You can try above solution if the company somehow does not have proper Microsoft 365 kit subscribed in their arsenal (I wonder how could that happen).

Obviously, if your company indeed have that Microsoft 365 right now & you're an active employee / student of that company / instution, then use that Microsoft Office, abosolutely. Above alternate solutions tend to have compatibility issues AFAIK. You can visit [Microsoft Website](https://www.microsoft.com/id-id/microsoft-365/get-office-and-microsoft-365-oem-download-page) ([or this](https://www.microsoft.com/id-id/microsoft-365/microsoft-office)) to get the Setup.exe of Microsoft Office apps.

### Outright be different

This is only good if your company had never been using Microsoft or any of their product over the past few decades. You can propose this new discipline to use more open standard than the rest, in order to achieve maximum compatibility across different sectors (except of course to those using mostly proprietary standards).

We personally recommend using [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download) ([Source code organization](https://gerrit.libreoffice.org/)) as of 2025, for our office document format needs.  
In this case of our DOOM mods, we used **LibreOffice Calc** to [Spreadsheet Language Translation](/LANGUAGE.ods). Basically, it's to make table consisting of strings for your GZDoom based game. You can alternatively use Google Sheet, like ZDoom used to [publicly face their translation string for reference & contributions](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pvwXEgytkor9SClCiDn4j5AH7FedyXS-ocCbsuQIXDU/edit?gid=501044242#gid=501044242) (See [LANGUAGE](https://zdoom.org/wiki/LANGUAGE) & [Internationalization](https://zdoom.org/wiki/Internationalization) on ZDoom Wiki). Additionally, you can add a carriage return (`Shift` + `Return / Enter` on a cell) to make new line in that string. When converted to CSV, GZDoom can still read that well, on a caveat of course that regular CSV editors will have a severe mental breakdown.

## How about home users?

If your case is not for a company, rather a personal user, a choice of Microsoft 365 Home is available which is the usual option.

Personally, I outright discourage everyone to ever use Microsoft 365 anymore or any of their subscription nor paid nor whatever product of that matter. The Open Source alternatives above nowadays should serve you much enough for what you need. And say that if not, you know what to do ðŸ˜œ.
