# Level of Production Quotience

From lowest (no quotience) to highest (maximum quotience)

- Redistribution & Import. A factory sell their cool products in wholesale. You buy, then just resell each of them. Once upon a time, you once again come to the Factories expo. You saw a new cool product from this factory company. Start negotiating for redistribution & success. Now, you can buy these at this much. You gotta sell as much as you can, so by the next restock, you can repay these stocks at a discount. More sales' better. You can now try hard to push down the price so it's sync with the origin's retail price where the factory born at, that attracts more people, more revenue. Win win!. Watchout tho, if your country hates the origin country where the factory was born at, you can get punished, socially scrutinized even if sometimes government had nothing to do with it, idk.
- Original Device Manufacturer (ODM). You request your brand to be slapped onto their device, then sell those as your brand. You don't have any idea what's this thing is, how it works, how's the quality, calibration, accuracy, etc. etc. Maybe you had interventions by putting your designs, your own software & its UI/UX, or what. We all realize, just doing this **personally gaves us no benefit whatsoever** when below, OEM, now has a cool brand for those products, know what they're doing, how to control the quality, accuracy, etc etc. Yeah of course, if an OEM already has ODM contracts one or many, they quality from the original factory (OEM) will suffer, coz they must cater to the usurpers (ODM) or else **there'll be conlict of interest**. I got cool OEM & upper brands below
- Original Equpipment Manufacturer (OEM). You have raw parts from various factories, all are nothing to do with yours. Components, modules, softwares, etc. Assemble together to become the product, and sell as your brand.
- Original Modules Manufacturer. The parts are from factories that are all yours (those parts may contain other parts from factories isn't yours, and/or some ready parts maybe factories isn't yours but way many less).
- Original Idea Manufacturer (OIM). Not only manufacture yourselves, the idea of such product & the parts are all yours (You may also didn't realize that you've stolen some patents that's not yours, who knows already expired anyways)!!! Remember, because you do everything yourself, it's very expensive. That is why people are dying for your patents & licenses, so other manufacturers can make the cheaper *Generic* version, which more people can afford. When all of your patents pertaining to the product all expire, you are no longer sole propriertor to the product, hence everyone has right to build the knock-off / *Generic* version of your cool product.

## Originalized Factory Brand I know

Maybe manufactured either in their place or licensed anywhere around the world. But, if all they do is just commission a factory to do this fully, without you owning that factory, that's ODM, and it may not list here. Help me verify if the brand is known for manufacturing on someone's house that isn't theirs so I can punish them.
