The following are camera classification to differentiate their feature sets, completeness, quirks, and prowess.

There are different types such as:

## Professional Camera

Also known as *Proper Camera*

A Professional Camera is a camera with all bells & whistles as possible. A Professional Camera will have all these mechanisms & features:

- Upon its Capture Media, is a Physical Shutter system. Such system has either or both types:
    - Rolling. a *Blind* Shutter that closes from one edge (of the Capture Media) to the other. Rolling Shutter usually has a pre-liminary shutter (located at the opposite edge of the other Shutter, Final Shutter) that closes the Capture Media first, opens and follows the Final Shutter in a synchronous tandem way, at a certain time to make the scanning either wide or tight, just like a Bed Scanner.
    - Global. a *Valve* Shutter that closes towards the center of the Capture Media. 
- Optionally has Built-in Flash (because you would use a better external flash anyways)
- (Optonally?) Has External Memory Card Slots / Film slots. Either as a main storage or a complementary. Some models may even have Built-in Storage system to cope with too slow speed required for their Image Capturing Specification.

There are sub-types of Professional Camera such as:

### Single Lens Reflex

- Works where the only system is the Capture Media, which usually also serves as monitorable.
- Monitorable / Viewfinder is merged into its Capture Media, and operates in a switching manner. Such types as
    - Mirror (a.k.a. DSLR)
    - Digital / EVF (Electronic Viewfinder) (a.k.a. Mirrorless)

### Twin Lens Reflex

- Works where Viewfinder acts standalone off of its Capture Media.
- Optionally, can turn into Single Lens Reflex, where its Capture Media becomes Monitorable & a digital display pops up into its Viewfinder optic (such as EVF)

## Typical Camera

Also known as *Pocket Camera*

A Typical Camera is a camera that have lesser features than Professional Camera, while atleast still has few important and cool features. A Typical Camera has mechanism & features

- May lacks Interchangable Lens system & other Interchangabilities. Instead, its Body has a Zoom Lens system & a Built-in Flash permanently affixed to it.
- Has Physical Shutter. Usually, only Global Shutter, but rarely can also be Rolling like Mirrorless Bridge. E.g., few Premium DJI Drone Cameras have that.
- Has External Memory Card Slots. Either as a main storage or a complementary

There are sub-types of Typical Camera such as:

### Bridge Camera

Bridge Camera is a Special Form of Typical Camera / Pocket Camera that ressembles the shape & almost functinalities of a Professional Camera. However again, they usually lacks interchangabilities of the Lens &/or Flash.

## Rudimentary Camera

Also known as *Toy Camera*

A Rudimentary camera is a minimally built & functional camera just for the purpose of capturing quick moment, budgets, and space constraint. Rudimentary Camera has these mechanism & features:

- Rudimentary Lenses. Permanently affixed Lens to help at least build image onto its Capture Media.
    - Optional Auto-focus
    - Optional Zooming system (RARE)
    - Optional Outer Protective Cover. An Interchangeable Cover either or both acting as extra Lenses or filters.
- Rudimentary Sensor / Capture Media.
- Rudimentary Audio Capture system. Sub-par or so-so microphone that at least captures audio.
    - Optionally has complete audio capture specification (such as Surround Sound, Noise Canceling, etc.)
- Rudimentary Flash. Not even a Xenon based, rather LEDs which is very slow & tends to have terrible Color Ranges / Wavelengths.
- Optionally has External Memory Card Slots. Either as a main storage or a complementary. Most models, especially Portable Computer devices primarily rely / uses their Built-in Storage System instead of External or ouright lacks such.
- Relies too heavily on Artificial Intelligence Enhancer System to enchance Output Captured Image. Example like Samsung Galaxy since S20s, where Moon photo (Farthest Lens photo the moon in the sky) will be manipulated automatically to make it looks like *it's working*.
- Lacks proper format of its Output Capture Image, such as no `.DNG` Photo and/or Cinema DNG (for RAW videos) feature. 3rd party app does not count, even if they turned back to Open Source & Gratis.

There are sub-types of Rudimentary Camera such as:

### Action Camera

An Action Camera is a ruggedly designed camera designed for extreme action. It has a very durable design that allows viewer to immerse themselves in the action when its recordings are played back / served. Action Camera has mechanism & features:

- Rugged Design. Takes extreme beating
- Optionally Interchangeable Cover. To replace broken cover, add lenses or filters.

### Embedded Camera

Also known as *Webcam*

a Camera system embedded onto Portable Computer devices. An Embedded Camera will be classified as Rudimentary super-category if their feature set fails to met above more premium super category.

e.g., [Huawei Pura 80 Ultra](https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_pura_80_ultra_5g-13944.php) no longer is Rudimentary, rather a Typical Camera / Pocket Camera, since this model met specifications to be considered as one.

There are also other Portable Computer devices that are basically a *Mirrorless camera that supports Android Apps*, and hence will be considered Professional Camera.
