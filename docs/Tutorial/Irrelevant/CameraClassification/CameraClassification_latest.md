The following are camera classification to differentiate their feature sets, completeness, quirks, and prowess.

There are different types such as:

## Professional Camera

Also known as *Proper Camera*

A Professional Camera is a camera with all bells & whistles as possible. A Professional Camera will have all these mechanisms & features:

- Upon its Capture Media, is a Physical Shutter system. Such system has either or both types:
    - Rolling. a *Blind* Shutter that closes from one edge (of the Capture Media) to the other. Rolling Shutter usually has a pre-liminary shutter (located at the opposite edge of the other Shutter, Final Shutter) that closes the Capture Media first, opens and follows the Final Shutter in a synchronous tandem way, at a certain time to make the scanning either wide or tight, just like a Bed Scanner.
    - Global. a *Valve* Shutter that closes towards the center of the Capture Media. 
- Adjustable Aperture. Usually each lens are responsible for it.
- Sensor / Capture Media size is considerably medium, from about 1 in, Micro 1/3, APS-C, and larger
- Saves its capture as a RAW Negative (DNG)
- Supports Remote Control
- Supports External Monitoring. Its Body has a display output connection which will be connected to a monitor for viewfinding.
- Can choose to Record with color setting in either HDR directly or LOG compressed
- Optionally has Built-in Flash (because you would use a better external flash & lightings anyways)
- ~~(Optonally?)~~ Has External Memory Card Slots / Film slots. Either as a main storage or a complementary. Some models may even have Built-in Storage system to cope with too slow speed required for their Image Capturing Specification.
- Optionally has Interchangable Sensor / Capture Media. To change Capture Media size or replace broken one.

There are sub-types of Professional Camera such as:

### Single Lens Reflex

- Works where the only system is the Capture Media, which usually also serves as monitorable.
- Monitorable / Viewfinder is merged into its Capture Media, and operates in a switching manner. Such types as
    - Mirror (a.k.a. DSLR)
    - Digital / EVF (Electronic Viewfinder) (a.k.a. Mirrorless)

### Twin Lens Reflex

- Works where Viewfinder acts standalone off of its Capture Media.
- Optionally, can turn into Single Lens Reflex, where its Capture Media becomes Monitorable & a digital display pops up into its Viewfinder optic (such as EVF)

### Cinema Camera

Cinema Camera is a special type of Professional Camera designed to record or broadcast Video.

A Cinema Camera will have all these mechanism & features:

- Records to RAW negatives (Cinema DNG, or anything that ressembles a sequence of DNG frames) (Roll Film with each Capture represents Frame). Feature is included and vital to how this type of Camera works.
- Assignable & Customizable buttons

## Typical Camera

Also known as *Pocket Camera*

A Typical Camera is a camera that have lesser features than Professional Camera, while atleast still has few important and cool features. A Typical Camera has mechanism & features

- May lacks Interchangable Lens system & other Interchangabilities. Instead, its Body has a Zoom Lens system & a Built-in Flash permanently affixed to it.
- Has Physical Shutter. Usually, only Global Shutter, but rarely can also be Rolling like Mirrorless Bridge. E.g., few Premium DJI Drone Cameras have that.
- Has Physical Apperture.
- Has External Memory Card Slots. Either as a main storage or a complementary
- Saves its capture as a RAW negative (DNG).

There are sub-types of Typical Camera such as:

### Bridge Camera

Bridge Camera is a Special Form of Typical Camera / Pocket Camera that ressembles the shape & almost functinalities of a Professional Camera. However again, they usually lacks interchangabilities of the Lens &/or Flash.

### Video Camera

Trademarked by Sony as *Handycam*

Video Camera is a special form factor of a Typical Camera that's usually designed to record a video. Unlike Cinema Camera, it obviously would lacks essential features from those Cinema Cameras.

A Video Camera has mechanism & features

- Records with considerable amount of Resolution & Frame Rate. Usually from up to 4K60 (4K at 60 FPS)
- Optionally can save its capture into RAW Negative Sequences (Cinema DNG). **3rd party app does not count**, unless they're return back to become Open Source again. Also, **only saving in MOV (ProRes) may not count either** (discuss!). Must be CDNG sequence or anything that stores all frames unmodified.
- Optionally can record with LOG color compression.

### Novelty Camera

> [!NOTE]
> Not to be confused with : [Slop Camera](#slop-camera)

A Special Camera that's designed for specific use case or an experimental purpose.

A Novelty Camera usually consists of functions, purpose, & case such as:

- Direct Printing. Once captured, its image is directly printed right away on the spot. Examples like Polaroid & billions of the followers (Instax et al). Some models do save its capture copy onto the flash storage to be shared or printed later, as well as printing other Documents rather than using the Body as the Camera.
- Thermal. A Camera used to capture temperature of an object. Instead of viewing in color, it shows a special coloring representing different temperature of which heat emited from. Examples like FLIR.
- Infrared. A Camera designed to see in after dark. Usually used by agencies to traverse around area in lights out, finding targets that failed to be seen on normal vision, etc.
- Sound. A *Camera* that's not a Camera, but a two dimensional array of microphones designed to capture sounds in a pin-pointed way. It's a Sound Camera! Echolocation (sort of)!
- Biometrics. Fingerprint / Palm Sensor. Usually used for Absencion in Enterprises, Access Doors, Biological Analysis, etc.
- Virtual. A *Camera* that lives in digital system to capture digital stuffs of itself. It's a Screen Capture softwares!. Examples like OBS, ShareX, etc.

## Rudimentary Camera

Also known as *Toy Camera*

A Rudimentary camera is a minimally built & functional camera just for the purpose of capturing quick moment, budgets, and space constraint. Rudimentary Camera has these mechanism & features:

- Rudimentary Lenses. Permanently affixed Lens to help at least build image onto its Capture Media.
    - Optional Auto-focus
    - Optional Zooming system (RARE)
    - Optional Outer Protective Cover. An Interchangeable Cover either or both acting as extra Lenses or filters.
- Rudimentary Sensor / Capture Media.
- Rudimentary Audio Capture system. Sub-par or so-so microphone that at least captures audio.
    - Optionally has complete audio capture specification (such as Surround Sound, Noise Canceling, etc.)
- Rudimentary Flash. Not even a Xenon based, rather LEDs which is very slow & tends to have terrible Color Ranges / Wavelengths.
- Optionally has External Memory Card Slots. Either as a main storage or a complementary. Most models, especially Portable Computer devices primarily rely / uses their Built-in Storage System instead of External or ouright lacks such.
- Relies too heavily on Artificial Intelligence Enhancer System to enchance Output Captured Image. Example like Samsung Galaxy since S20s, where Moon photo (Farthest Lens photo the moon in the sky) will be manipulated automatically to make it looks like *it's working*.
- Lacks proper format of its Output Capture Image, such as no `.DNG` Photo and/or Cinema DNG (for RAW videos) feature. 3rd party app does not count, even if they turned back to Open Source & Gratis.

There are sub-types of Rudimentary Camera such as:

### Action Camera

An Action Camera is a ruggedly designed camera designed for extreme action. It has a very durable design that allows viewer to immerse themselves in the action when its recordings are played back / served. Action Camera has mechanism & features:

- Rugged Design. Takes extreme beating
- Optionally Interchangeable Cover. To replace broken cover, add lenses or filters.

### Embedded Camera

Also known as *Webcam*

a Camera system embedded onto Portable Computer devices. An Embedded Camera will be classified as Rudimentary super-category if their feature set fails to met above more premium super category.

e.g., [Huawei Pura 80 Ultra](https://www.gsmarena.com/huawei_pura_80_ultra_5g-13944.php) no longer is Rudimentary, rather a Typical Camera / Pocket Camera, since this model met specifications to be considered as one.

There are also other Portable Computer devices that are basically a *Mirrorless camera that supports Android Apps*, and hence will be considered Professional Camera.

### Slop Camera

a special type of camera (wrangling all above up to Professional Camera level) that has unecessary gimmicks, even most of the time re-add more infuriations than a help.

a Slop Camera would usually does / promote:

- Requires login. The camera requires you to login *to complete oobe setup* (or even make it immediately usable), either absolute or with free guest trial. Examples like DJI, Insta360, Microsoft (wait, what are you doing here? Oh, Windows, but that's not camera!), et al.; except GoPro, Sony, Nikon, Canon, Olympus, Casio, Xiaomi (verification needed, outdated verif!), few al.
- Emulate Physical Film Afdrug Long time. A capture file would reside in its storage but either part of the firmware or software artificially *walls* you to retrieve them immediately and you must *play* waiting for that afdrug / baking process. Some ideas be like to paywall retrieval to *decrypt* them like all captures are ransomware'd
- Partialism. Some of the feature in its Firmware requires a separate license to use them. One known camera that does this was Sony Venice Cinema Camera series.
- Emulated form of *storage media*. A Camera product that only saves and/to read that manufacturer specifically designed storage media. Examples like a Yashica camera with Film-like Flash Storage media that seems only compatible with that Camera. Btw, each *different type* of Flash-Film represents different style & effect (that's the only way to FX), rather than usually doing it through menus on Common Camera Firmware / Application Software.
