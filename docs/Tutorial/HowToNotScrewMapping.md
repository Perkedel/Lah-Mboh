## Introduction

**(Roofi)** Hi all !

After reading some mapping tutorials, I want to share my tips for very beginners in order to maximize their chance to create a decent first baby map. Contrary to a real tutorial, it will not talk about technical points like how to create a door or a lift , but rather recommend or advise against certain designs.

### Why do I want to create this "tutorial"?

Starting mapping is hard, even when the builder is simple like Ultimate Doombuilder. Except if you're called Huy Pham for instance, your first map will be likely dull at best and maybe full of mapping errors. Sometimes, your map will get positive feedback and it's good for your or it will be disliked and it may break your will to pursue mapping.

A considerable number of mappers are not confident enough to take negative feedback, and it is in their best interest that their first map is well received in order to get off to a good start on a possibly successful mapping career.

### How is this tutorial structured?

This tutorial just consists to a series of advices. I'm conscious that mapping tastes are highly subjectives. This tutorial is not really for someone who dreams of imitating Ribbiks or Sunder's maps, but rather someone who doesn't have a clear idea of what he wants to do yet.

The only goal of my advices is just to maximise the chances of having a well received first map.

FYI : Advices 8 to 12 were written by Wilou-84 , I just translated them. All credits go for him.

So,

## Advices

### Advice n°1 : Know the game mechanics

Before jumping on the builder, it is important to know the monsters of Doom or the weapons. 
For example, how much health does a cyberdemon, an arch-vile or a revenant have? A priori, if you start mapping you are already an absolute fan of the game, but read up on it via the doomwiki for example or play more wads if you have any doubts.

[Doomwiki](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Entryway)

### Advice n°2 : Be generous with supplies (health, armor, ammo)

It is true that having too much ammunition and health can turns an adventure into a walk in the park. 
However, running out of ammunition and health at critical moments is most of the time a source of frustration than entertainment. Keeping the fun while depriving the player of resources is a real challenge in mapping. For a first map, I recommend putting more items than needed. Even an enthusiast of hard maps will be happy to be well equipped.

As is often said, better too much than not enough.

> ![NOTE]
> Repeated moments of resource depletion causes casual Doomers to give up and/or start using cheats!
> Always test your WAD maps like if you were a noob & optimize that all casual Doomers would have the time & will to finish
> This one key you must remember is **Resource Guarantee**.

### Advice n°3 : Avoid making a difficult map.

Creating a hard map is extremly simple. However, keeping the level entertaining enough for the player to want to try again and again is another story. It notably requires good skills at balancing things.

Your first  level can and even should have some traps and tougher parts but ensure that the player always have a certain margin of error.

> [!NOTE]
> Avoid terrywadding any of your maps! (adding loud screamers and/or outright impossibility).
> e.g., if you have to make a *terrywads* moment, simply do up to End Death, that only includes Icon of Sin scream, no more.

### Advice n°4 : Don't make aesthetics your main priority

You perhaps already seen a lot of outstanding screens of doom maps with a gigantic architecture and details galore. (i.e Sunder) but remember Doom is a videogame and the main objective of a videogame is to spend a good time.

Also, everyone can make a fun map because it only requires to know the game mechanics (see Advice n°1), whereas creating great aesthetics require more technical skills related to the builder and which are acquired more over time.

Also, take into account that mapping is a time-consuming activity and spending a lot of time on visuals can quickly be discouraging, especially when you don't master the techniques to optimise the work.

> [!NOTE]
> The key of mapping is the functionality first. aesthetics second.  
> While it makes your WAD very cool to look at, It is **completely okay 9999999999999.99999%** to omit aesthetics, e.g. due to deadline, or outright too lazy.
> 
> Additionally, you may try to make a special 3D model Decorate actors if Doomcute-ing (Sector detail aesthetic that resembles daily items) feels too cumbersome & limited.  
> Again, this is also completely optional.
> 
> Lastly, if why your level goes like this, at least build yourself the reason doomcute, as working as possible.  
> e.g., Why there are alot of Berserks in the kitchen, and a dead imp on a cooking table? Well, this kitchen is where the Freeloader Lord makes his food. 
> Like, he slaughters unfortunately aggressive & unfriendable died freeloader souls. Then make them his only food as he's forever stuck in hell.  
> Actually, we currently have no idea how does Freedoom's berserk is like, but there was one on original DOOM. Well, you get the idea.

### Advice n°5 : Avoid making a long map.

Like the difficult maps, it is easy to create a long map. 
It would be enough to join a ton of rooms without coherence to create one. 
Nonetheless, A long map must be worth exploring, otherwise it becomes a complete slog. 
If your map is full of backtracks with switches all over the place, players may get bored quickly.

Also, take into account that making a long map usually takes longer to create. 
I recommend making a small or medium sized map to get feedback fairly soon. 
It is likely that the first map will be full of errors. 
The sooner they are detected, the sooner you will learn to adopt better mapping techniques. 

> [!NOTE]
> Longmaps such as [Okuplok Slaugther map](https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Okuplok_Slaughter_Map) ([Download, Click the title](https://dsdarchive.com/wads/oku2v31)) will be a nightmare if you died somewhere on no-save run. 
> Because you **restart the whole map!**  
> Therefore, longmaps extremely requires lots of QuickSave.
> 
> You can try no-save there, if you still say you're the expert like those veterans..

### Advice n°6  Test your map many times and in many different ways

To avoid failure, don't hesitate to test a load of times, on different ports if possible, in order to prevent possible problems. Adopt different routes when the map allows it, climb everywhere to find the softlocks. In short, go through your map from top to bottom.

> [!NOTE]
> There are tiers that you have to know:
>
> For source ports, ensure you got these working well when played on your target audience personal preferences
> - Core (CRITICAL & Atleast), All casuals entering Modern DOOM in general: GZDoom & Derivatives
> - MBF21, All Enthusiasts used to recent standards: DSDA
> - Vanilla, All Enthusiasts prefer to be purist like original days: DSDA, Chocolate
> 
> Map formats are also important!
> - Core (CRITICAL & Atleast): UDMF
> - MBF21: Doom MBF
> - Vanilla: Doom
> targeting modern DOOM should start with UDMF, but if you target strict vanilla compatibility, you must use legacy Doom format.
>
> **There is no shame if you fail to target vanilla nor mbf21 compatibility!** Just make it work! Don't listen to those naysayers!

### Advice n°7 : Don't hesitate to have other people testing your map before you release it.

If you still have doubts about your testing, ask other people to test your map before its release. It's in fact not uncommon to be surprised, even for an experienced mapper! Some people have radically playing style than yours.

Here is a list of playtesters you can take contact : [Austinado's Playtesters Contact list](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/118850-who-can-test-your-maps-list-of-active-playtesters/)

> [!NOTE]
> Want me to also test? You know where I am, & who's my name. just make sure to have `DOOM PLS PLAYTEST` & upload to website I can access.   
> WARNING, your level maybe yoinked to my `Bring your own USB` Lah-Mboh DLC repository if it's a cloud storage & direct file,. So if you don't want this, use [itch.io](https://itch.io), maybe..
> 
> Details:  
> **Active/Partial Playtesters**: Partial  
> **Preferred difficulty**: (3) Hurt me plenty, (1) I'm too young to die  
> **Number of maps in a set (Max/Min)**: Max first 5, Min any. You may tell explicitly which one I should try.
> **Genres don't like**: Slaughter
> **Preferred souce ports**: GZDoom (& Derivatives), DSDA (for down to vanilla compatibilty & strict quirks that fail on GZDoom)
> **Refused source ports**: all others
> **Prefered IWAD if it's a PWAD**: Freedoom Phase 2 (DOOM II & Final DOOM replacement coverages)
> **Refused IWAD**: -
> **Demos or written comments**: both
> **Contact (Personal forum thread/ Private message)**: I'm sorry, I don't have any I can share publicly. But just guess it by trying to query my username on your *favourite* popular POC chat app.
> **Notes**: Here:
>
> Rules:
> - Use persistent public website! If not, your files will be yoinked on sight, no exception.
> - No Closed beta! If you insist, give me permission to reupload that file for everyone therefore to try. If you afraid, then finish it up and make it publicly available.
> - this PWAD must costs $0. Currently refuse if PWAD is above $0.
> - No slaughter! I'll use cheats if you do that, unless you gave long time Invulnerability script or something that makes it look easy for all casuals. Or if there has to be, make that optional and escapable with all those demons & Completer Items marked No Completition.
> - Yes Jokewad! I need entertainment. Days rougher every second!
> - NO Terrywad! No screamer allowed! (You'll break my customers ears) If you have to, only rely on Icon of Sin like in End Death & end of E1 episode. & if you really must have terrywad, make the death End Level or whatever fun to watch.
> - Even though I already purchased DOOM I + II, I still use Freedoom IWAD. It's okay if you wish me to use those original IWADs instead (e.g. due to arts that explicitly derives original DOOM). But you are not allowed to make macros that prevent Doomers from playing your mod if say they are on Freedoom, not DOOM (That's corpo level of greed DRM practices!).
> - NSFW allowed. e.g., Duke Nukem like H stuffs

### Advice n°8 : Make sure you know the difference between a "training map" and a real map that deserves to be released

When you are new to mapping, you can for example make an attempt at a map to learn how to use the map editor, learn line actions, learn how to make doors etc. 
This results in a "training map", i.e. a map that has been used as a sandbox to learn the basics. 
These "training maps" are only used for that, and are often not meant to be played in public, as they would not be of interest to the majority of players.

When you're done with the training, it's better to start from scratch (i.e. make a brand new map) than to keep working on the training map and release it.
Nobody wants to play a map that starts with something very basic and ends with something better. We want to play directly to what is better.

> [!NOTE]
> Avoid deleting your training map in the source code. 
> Put it somewhere in the attic like [Freedoom](https://github.com/freedoom/attic) did 
> so your customers can see how were you began & progressed, then learn, you're just like them, a humble beginner.

### Advice n°9 : Don't go straight for something very ambitious

Some mappers, like [Huy Pham with his famous Deus Vult](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/d-f/dv) or [skepticist with SkePLand](https://www.doomworld.com/idgames/levels/doom2/Ports/s-u/skepland), made a very strong impression with their first maps, which were great and had real concepts. But you have to keep in mind that these are exceptional cases, these people knew exactly what they were doing. In general, a mapper's first map is not great, because the mapper is learning the tool, because the mapper has to find his or her own style, and because the mapper doesn't yet have the maturity and technical expertise to do something really exceptional from the start.

With this in mind, I recommend not to start with something too ambitious for our first map. If you already have a lot of ideas, if you want to do an episode (or a megawad), that's fine, but let's wait until you've released two or three maps before you start. This will allow us to really get the hang of it, and our future episode (or megawad) will be all the better for it.

> [!NOTE]
> Again, DO NOT & NEVER force yourself to be impressive the first try!! 
> You always have alot of stuffs to do than just start dedicating yourself into a rabbithole.  
> I've learned this the hard way, that, to solve a problem in a rabbit hole, requires that another esoteric methods to solve, that probably is beyond your knowledges & capabilities.  
> As a result, it is very terrible, & unlikable, heck may get you banned (if they're not DNB POC guaranteed & hence super toxic).

### Advice n°10 : Do not copy and paste parts of maps made by another author

Doom mapping is an art, and, just like a piece of music or a book, plagiarism of one or several maps is to be absolutely forbidden. 
You must not copy and paste sectors or pieces of maps from someone else's work. 
Firstly, it will be seen (the Doom community is full of experts), and secondly, it does nothing for your personal progress as a mapper.

On the other hand, imitating is good. It's even recommended! 

You should imitate the mappers you like.

> [!NOTE]
> Copying outright even from `Authors MAY use the contents of this file as a base for..` does not mean reuse! It's just reuploading or whatever.
> Instead, look carefully, and then recreate. Once you have mastered that technic, you can rebuild it again, & again per levels.
> You can prefab the stuff you'd like but we recommend that you do this, if the part is not too big and worth palleting.
> 
> e.g., our Mboh Adventure first map is a knock-off of DOOM I E1M1, but with this building a different reason. 
> On DOOM it's the space airport, while here is an immigration center where travelers sign up & handle entry documents as they've arrived in this country the lore setting is at. 
> Notice lots of A11y (Accessibility) around this building (such as Lift alternate to stair, Ramp covering or replacing stairs, etc.). 
> This is because this place is also the entry for Leg Surgery sign up where travelers come far just to get operated like coming to Singapore to apply extreme surgery where own nation doesn't have such service.
> Additionally, it's an inspiration towards [Wani Hug Visual Novel](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1895350/I_Wani_Hug_that_Gator/) where a love target gator, Olivia, is leg down paralyzed.
>
> another e.g., we also ripped offs DOOM I E1M2, into Water Processing cave in level 2 of this Mboh Adventure.
>
> & to make it fair, we also ripped off Freedoom Phase 2 Quadrant Key level (MAP04) in level Travelexer.
>
> Now, unless for testing purpose, overall, you should avoid outright copy pasting someone else's map regardless if it's `Authors MAY use the contents of this file as a base for..`.  
> The key for this one is: *Just be creative Even tho I'm succ, so I may remake & immitate other parts of whom I know*.

### Advice n°11 : Understand that you are exposed to criticism, and be prepared for it

If we put a map out in public, it will be played, and judged. The players will give an opinion on it, good or bad, and this is quite normal. Of course, most people will be indulgent (even benevolent) towards the work of a beginner, but we must understand and integrate the fact that our work will be exposed to others, and to their criticism. If the map is appreciated, so much the better, and if it is not appreciated, we will get some more unpleasant reviews, but that is normal. That's how we move forward.

That's also why I recommended above not to start with something too ambitious. We risk getting our heads up by saying that our map is great, only to be disappointed if the map doesn't appeal.

> [!NOTE]
> Rough how to differenciate criticisms (may not represent all patterns)
>
> Constructive:  
> On Level *XYZ*, there is *ABCDEFG*, I suggess that you add *Lorem Ipsum* so it's easier for casual player
>
> Destructive:  
> This level succ (no additional info)

### Advice n°12 : Prepare for the fact that our first map will not be noticed

In addition to what I'm saying above, it's also important to understand one thing: there are a ton of Doom maps coming out all the time. As I write this, Doomer Boards released DBP 51 called Deadly Ritual, and Joshy and his team released Plutonia Revisited Community Project 2 last week.

That means we're completely swamped with wads. Unless you're unemployed, it's impossible to play everything, so players will prioritise what they play. And in the face of these wads made by experienced mappers, will our first map be able to stand out, fresh and dapper as it is?
Not sure...

So we have to be mentally prepared for the possibility that our map will not be played and will not necessarily find its audience (even if it is good!). This should not discourage us.

> [!NOTE]
> Extra things you can try to increase clout:
> - YouTube. Use OBS & record your gameplay of your WAD.
> - TikTok (NOT RECOMMENDED). Same, but censor the blood!
> - Relatives. Tell your family that you make something cool of this WAD. E.g., tell that the BGM Christian song on this level is your own creation.
>
> Have levels but hate it when that misses the clout? Send that to me! You know where, & what my name is. Make sure your level is publicly downloadable & its link persistent, such as [itch.io](https://itch.io)
