# How to `TEXTURES.txt`

There is a new procedure in DOOM texturing, by defining your texture sturffs in a text file rather than legacy TEXTUREx lumps.

Simply create a new text file at the root of your project WAD: `TEXTURES.txt`.

This definition uses humanely recognizable syntax like many other plain text based lumps. & in SLADE, double clicking this file opens the same TEXTURE table editor, with added features unlike with legacy TEXTUREx.

## Conversion

In SLADE, you can convert your old TEXTUREx lumps into new TEXTURES.txt plain text definitions. It's in the right click menu.
