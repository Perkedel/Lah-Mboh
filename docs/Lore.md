# Mboh Adventure Lore

The year, 2100s.

100 years after defeating so many Harrassers locked in one place thancc to a hero from RadioComms faction named Lancaster (in Surreal Blender Meme x Zenless Zone Zero fangame), the DNB & the citizens thrives while Harrassers got pressed way further until ultimately becomes too weak to Harrass, and hence *Bankrupt* universe-wide.  
The remnants, now codenamed Invaders began Rising Up to bring back their glorious days of Entitlements. An invasion has occurred in serveral DNB mentored realms by these Invaders as a revenge against late first Kaorfa (JOELwindows7), the man whose his former friends betrayed, the man that built the world to rescue people from Invaders' parents, & the man that helped people defeat those Harrassers till his last breath.  
You are once again hired but by non other that DNB Organization itself to tackle those Invaders from overtaking people's home & causing them to suffer again like in Century 21st. You will be sent to those invasion target & must eliminate those members.  
Unfortunately, since their parents lost their social media accounts & DNB has protected the digital world for good with POC License, these Invasion descendants returned using physical weapons, as they are very desperate.  
It is not mess around, they are already trained as much their parents do with Social Medias.
Luckily, DNB has countless copy of weapons, as well as your skill you brought from your carreer in your original universe (i.e. Bring your own TC!).

## Gameplay

You will play in whatever fighting style you see fit. You can keep your experience as minimally vanilla-like as possible, but also as maximum as imbalance as you wanted it to be. Whatever the case you are, DNB will always provide the appropriate weapons for your job.

Since the enemies are the remnants of the long gone Harrasser, and never took standard educations by over 100 fiscal years, alongside zero brain of anything but Entitlement, they also do not understand MERCY at all. At which point, they're considered Zombies, and you should be having zero guilt after FIGHTing countless numbers of them.

Therefore everything you do, goes back to where it all started: Rip & Tear. Never been in this gameplay & enjoyment in 130 years doesn't it?

## Characters

There is no definite main character who should be in this Mboh Adventure, because everything is up to you, what Mod PK3 you'd like to load? Do you want it simple? Or OverPowered? Or maybe Complicated?

### Freedoom guy

This is the character you'll have if you didn't load replacing character mod. We're gonna assume that you used Freedoom Phase 2 IWAD as instructed in this Mod PK3 installation instruction document.

After defeating Invasion in his home universe, Freedoom guy then goes to nowhere to retire. Nowhere, where noone could find him ever again.  
He was getting bored, alone, and hence tight, stress, lonely. Episodes after episodes of his contemplation only brings back the horror memory full of loss & despair. But he presevered, and presevered to never come back to some city.

Thankfully, DNB has found Freedoom guy, and brought him to a new place somewhere in Surreal Blender Meme realm here in Perkedel Cinematic Universe. This subrealm here was somehow powered by GZDoom due to technical difficulties. But it works.  
He can train there & resharpen his long blunted skill back to his initial might.

### DaNeBeau
He is an AI intelligent construct, much like VEGA in Doom. You can always hear him talk during Level Entry, doorbell, and sometimes midway during battle. 

His favourite color is **Red Brick**.

### ExodusCat

Mel Starrasch, descendant of the Arenod Sediron kingdom DNA family. She was one of the assistant for your commission fighting the Invaders. Well, it's just her & her boyfriend, because this new agency is very small, & the agent is only you, the player.

Because of this, one would consider her job is extremely hectic, but it's not since again, you're the only agent DNB trusted.

She looks like Ankha from just a hundred years ago some game, hence the reason she's sometime called that, & even Freedoom version of Ankha. Instead of being mad, she's glad being the one that replaces the proprietary ones.

Her favourite color is **Blue** & **Yellow**.

## Reality Check

While as usual this is a fictional story in Perkedel Cinematic Universe, as always, part of IRL elements are ported to here, especially from Joel himself. Yes, it's real. He was betrayed by his former friends irl, after went into breaking point in his beloved community, where other members kept hating him for no reason. The vent room only brings backlash instead of pity & support by those entitled people who claimed to know everything about *social protection*, when in reality, they don't know enough. Infact noone knows at all.

Based on True Story. Other IRL parts ported may includes real social condition during first & second part of Century 21st & perhaps until late before going into 22nd.

## Extra

Don't worry, the Harrassers are fine, we've ressurrected them directly in Judgement realm.

Just be careful, `sudo rm -rf /` No preserve root (The skill Lancaster used) is the worst idea ever. Under any circumstances should you never ever touch nor think about it. Lucky Surreal Blender Meme always backs up, & Lancaster did unmounted everything & disabled every network adapters before he do this.

### In case you're curious

Surreal Blender Meme x Zenless Zone Zero FInal Chapter. You've successfully deflated all 3 Big Hollows. 

Belle, Wise, & friends are ready to go back to home. The stuffs belonging to ZZZ are transported first, then the people. The Portal was opened at somewhere more desolate in Outer Ring to avoid attention.
Lancaster suddenly decided to pay a visit to universe ZZZ for a while as he is curious, despite the still ever-dangerous the Earth there is with Hollow that could come at anytime.  
As the world finally once again become quiet (Stuff + People done, left Lancaster & Mike), They prepared and contemplate a bit for this travel. Then, Mike walked first & Lancaster ensures noone's left.

Suddenly, a red giant sword about to be swung against the only portal while Mike is walking there. Lancaster without hesitation uses his Ultimate to push Mike to that portal fast. Mike then thrown into the Outer Ring, & a millisecond then the sword crushed the Portal & Lancaster thrown back. Mike went suprised, and read Lancaster mind again.  
Oh no, it's a Harrasser?! Immediately, Lancaster deployed his forcefield shield to the ground, enclosing himself. All of the sudden, trillions of Harrassers assembled realm wide & surrounded that sphere. Mike & friend there in Outer Ring immediately went on looking ways to rescue Lancaster from crowds of Harrassers and commence purged cleanup. Alas, as combined Eitsch & nerds looking safe spot, no surface available to deploy portal that could risk contaminating whole Outer Ring with Harrassers. And disasterously, these Harrassers has applied Sacrifice (in cutscene somewhere of Sacrifice+Proprietarism Combining Experiment), hence they are a hybrid of Ethereal+Proprietarism that can go outside Hollow. There's simply no way. Lancaster must stuck or portal inside the sphere but still risk 100% the outbreak.

At that moment, Lancaster saw a familiar face. That Harrasser is non-other than Harrasser Bleak, who revenged against his parents, because his parents were Interpols (Homestuck Interpol Perkedel fanfic). Bleak tumored Lancaster's dad irrecoverably, as Bleak has a skill to manifest a deadly tumor to anyone he dislikes. So, Lancaster at last had him locked in, and as this gone no more ways, he decided to take down his beloved world with him & all Harrassers. Lancaster then created a final BTRFS snapshot, upload the full backup to somewhere, disabled all network adapters & then unmounted every external disks but the root itself. Mike confused for what he's about to do. Lancaster then typed `sudo rm -rf --no-reserve-root /` on his SSH tablet.  
WAIT NO!!! The Distro thankfully canceled the operation as it's of course a stupid operation. But after this was commenced, the Distro offers to break the barrier if you add `--dnb` to the same command. So he did. 3 times it needed to break the barrier. Mike & friend panik, Lancaster is commiting suicide! At the 4th commence, you must add the final *Last Word* flag into your command. So he did. And before he press enter, he gone make impromptu short speech, ended up with this:

> Do Not Block me.

Press enter.

.

.

The world implodes earrapely & everything gone bright. Mike & friend cried, Lancaster pushed off the chair! All Harrassers that unfortunately cannot portal & others are going to be deleted alongside Lancaster. One by one, Lancaster's limb began to deteoriate & dismembers.   
The blood that gushes turns into null vapour. The sky gone magenta. His body slowly turned into purple necrosis. MIke can only cry that's he gone crazy. As the world gone whitening, we are suddenly disconnected, then moved into the Outer Ring camera.

Lancaster has died a world right away. The Surreal Blender Meme has been wiped clean. Mike fell shocked like that scene in Breaking Bad. While it seems reckless to do suicide for any reason, its effect indeed mark the ofiicial defeat of Harrassers, since they too are reckless for bringing so many of them in, to attack Lancaster only because he deleted Hollow that's it. The Harrasser could've done something else than profiting off of these infuriating Hollow that in this case is basically a UNIX compatible virus rather than an actual Etheric lumps. Although possess the same effect as the actual Hollow.

Of course, in relieve, days later, Lancaster & Harrassers are all resurrected by DNB Resurrector Division. Along with the stuffs 100% recovered from backup. The Harrassers were ressurect-pulled at a new subrealm in Judgement Realm, and Lancaster in a Judgement Hospital Subrealm. Then immediately, Lancaster sent to the ZZZ close at where Mike & friends hang out right now, which is to Random Play front pavement. The reunion goes as Lancaster entered the store front door, & the rest is history.


## Great luck, God Bless you
