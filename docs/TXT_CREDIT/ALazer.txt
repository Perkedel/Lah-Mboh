Inspiration Note: After getting inspired by a friend of mine in one of my art classes in college, I researched the Shoop Da Whoop and got a kick out of it. After seeing that this laser type of thing and seeing how powerful it is, why not put something like that in Doom. I tested this on some monster heavy wads and man, it made Hell turn into Heaven (Easier). I hope you all will enjoy it and laugh your butt off. Don't forget to FIRE YOUR LAZAH!!!!!! LOL.
