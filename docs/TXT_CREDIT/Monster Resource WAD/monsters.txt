Description             : A collection of monsters freely available to any
                          wad authors. Though the wad is designed for ZDoom
                          use with DECORATE, the sprites can be used freely
                          as well.
                          This is version 2.0 of the monster WAD that fixes
                          a few bugs and adds several new monsters.
                          See info.txt for a short description of the monsters.

                          v3.0 contains a few minor bugfixes and some new monsters:
                          -The Plasma Elemental
                          -The Maelstrom
                          -The Cacolich
                          -The RifleZombie
                          -The SpreadFireZombie
                          
                          v4.0 fixes a bug with the Terror and adds custom
                          blood colors to the Cacolantern and Hell Warrior.
                          A few sounds have been renamed as well.
