Description             : Few Ultimate Doom WADs have stood the test of time
                          as well as the 2011 E1 replacement "Double Impact"
                          by RottKing and Ralphis, a collection of sprawling
                          techbases with agile action. In addition to being
                          released as a standalone PWAD, Double Impact became
                          the fourth episode of the IWAD replacement
                          Freedoom: Phase 1 in 2013, and in 2020 became an
                          official add-on for the Unity port of Doom,
                          introducing it to a wider audience than even the
                          best Doom WADs usually receive.
                          
                          One small flaw in this otherwise great WAD is its
                          incomplete soundtrack. The original PWAD contained
                          two original tracks and two remixes of Bobby
                          Prince's music. In Freedoom, due to the limitations
                          of the engine, Double Impact simply reuses music
                          from the first three episodes, in the same pattern
                          that Ultimate Doom's fourth episode did, meaning
                          that the music selections fit only a little better
                          than random chance. This project aims to fix that
                          flaw by providing a new soundtrack for the WAD that
                          can be used with both the PWAD and Freedoom: Phase
                          1, and which, in the spirit of Freedoom, is
                          absolutely free to reuse and remix. 

Special thanks          : RottKing for Double Impact.
                          Ralphis for Double Impact, and also for providing
                          some early feedback on the idea for the project.
                          Everyone who's contributed to Freedoom and the
                          wider ecosystem of open-source software and games.
                          Palitoman and Bobby were set to contribute to this
                          pack, but never finished their contributions due to
                          my (continuum.mid) lack of due diligence in keeping
                          the project alive. Thanks for contributing and I'm
                          sorry for taking so long.
